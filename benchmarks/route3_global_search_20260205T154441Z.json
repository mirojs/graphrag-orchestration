            "text": "Below is a document\u2011by\u2011document summary of all **termination/cancellation** rules, with explicit notice periods, cancellation windows, and refund/forfeiture outcomes where stated.\n\n---\n\n## 1. BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION (Fabrikam Inc. \u2194 Contoso Ltd.)\n\n### a. Automatic termination by passage of time\n\n- The warranty coverage begins on the **date of final settlement** or the **date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**, whichever comes first. [1][2][3][5][11]  \n- The warranty **terminates** after either **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) days**, depending on the specific coverage, measured from that commencement date. [1][2][3][5][11]  \n- Any claims not made in writing within the applicable **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) day** period are **not covered** (\u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING\u2026 WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE\u2026 ARE NOT COVERED\u201d). This functions as a time\u2011based termination of coverage for unasserted claims. [2][3][5][11]\n\n### b. Termination upon transfer of the home\n\n- The warranty is **\u201cNot Transferable\u201d** and is extended only to the first purchaser (Contoso Ltd. as Buyer/Owner). [1][2][3][5][11]  \n- If the first purchaser **sells the home** or **moves out of it**, the limited warranty **\u201cautomatically terminates.\u201d** [1][2][3][5][11]\n\n### c. Survival of arbitration provisions after termination\n\n- The Arbitration Program explicitly states that its provisions **\u201cshall survive any termination, amendment, or expiration hereof or of the Documents unless the Parties otherwise expressly agree in writing.\u201d** [12]  \n- This means that even after the warranty itself terminates (by time or by sale/move\u2011out), the obligation to arbitrate disputes continues unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. [12]\n\n### d. No separate \u201ccancellation\u201d right / no refund rule\n\n- The warranty text does **not** provide a discretionary \u201cright to cancel\u201d by either party within a set number of days, nor any refund/forfeiture rule tied to cancellation. It only provides:\n  - Time\u2011limited coverage (1 year / 60 days). [2][3][5][11]  \n  - Automatic termination on sale/move\u2011out. [1][2][3][5][11]  \n- Therefore, this document has **termination rules** (time\u2011based and transfer\u2011based) but **no explicit cancellation window with refund/forfeiture** like the purchase contract below.\n\n---\n\n## 2. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Short Term/Vacation Rentals)  \n**Parties: Contoso Ltd. (Owner) and Walt Flood Realty (Agent)**\n\n### a. Term and renewal\n\n- The agreement has an **initial period of twelve months** beginning on **2010-06-15**. [4][7][13]  \n- It is **\u201cautomatically renewed for successive one year terms thereafter.\u201d** [4][7][13]\n\n### b. Sixty (60) days written notice termination right\n\n- Either party may terminate the agreement **\u201cupon sixty (60) days written notice.\u201d** [4][7][13]  \n- This is a mutual termination right; no cause is required in the text. [4][7][13]\n\n### c. Effect of termination on existing rental agreements and obligations\n\n- **Existing rental agreements remain valid:**  \n  \u201cTermination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.\u201d [4][7][13]  \n- **Owner remains responsible for obligations/expenses incurred by Agent:**  \n  \u201cUpon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.\u201d [4][7][13]\n\n### d. Confirmed reservations must be honored after termination or sale\n\n- The agreement states:  \n  \u201cIn the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.\u201d [4][7][13]  \n- This creates a continuing obligation for Contoso Ltd. (Owner) to honor reservations even after:\n  - Termination by **60 days written notice**, or  \n  - Sale of the property. [4][7][13]\n\n### e. No explicit refund/forfeiture rule\n\n- The Property Management Agreement does **not** specify any **refund** or **deposit forfeiture** mechanism tied to termination (e.g., no clause saying the Owner or Agent must refund or may keep any particular deposit upon termination). [4][7][13]  \n- Thus, it has a **\u201csixty (60) days written notice\u201d** termination mechanism but **no explicit cancellation window with a refund/forfeiture outcome.** [4][7][13]\n\n---\n\n## 3. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT  \n**Parties: Contoso Ltd. (Owner) and Fabrikam Inc. (Pumper)**\n\n### a. Open\u2011ended term with termination by either party\n\n- The contract states:  \n  \u201cThis agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract.\u201d [6][14]  \n- This creates an **indefinite term** that continues until either Contoso Ltd. (Owner) or Fabrikam Inc. (Pumper) chooses to terminate. [6][14]\n\n### b. No specified notice period\n\n- The contract does **not** specify any **notice period** (e.g., no \u201c30 days\u201d or \u201c60 days\u201d requirement) for termination by either party. [6][14]  \n- Therefore, there is a termination right, but the timing and form of notice are not defined in the text. [6][14]\n\n### c. Obligation to file changes/new contract within 10 business days\n\n- If there is a **change in this contract**, the owner must file a copy of any changes or a new service contract with the municipality and County **\u201cwithin ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract.\u201d** [6][14]  \n- This **10 business days** requirement is an administrative filing obligation triggered by a change (which could include termination and replacement), not a notice period for termination itself. [6][14]\n\n### d. No cancellation window / no refund or forfeiture rule\n\n- The contract contains **no \u201cright to cancel\u201d window** (e.g., no \u201c3 business days\u201d or similar) and **no refund/forfeiture** language regarding any deposit or prepayment. [6][14]  \n- Thus, it has a **termination right** (either party may terminate) but **no defined cancellation period or refund rule.** [6][14]\n\n---\n\n## 4. PURCHASE CONTRACT (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\n### a. Right to cancel \u2013 3 business days\n\n- The contract includes a specific **\u201cRight to Cancel\u201d** clause:  \n  \u201cCustomer may cancel within **3 business days** for full refund.\u201d [9][10][15]  \n- This is an explicit **3 business days cancellation period** during which the Customer (Fabrikam Inc.) can cancel the contract. [9][10][15]\n\n### b. Refund/forfeiture outcome tied to the cancellation window\n\n- The same clause states: **\u201cAfterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d** [9][10][15]  \n- Therefore:\n  - If the Customer cancels **within 3 business days**, they receive a **full refund**. [9][10][15]  \n  - If the Customer cancels **after 3 business days**, the **deposit is forfeited** (i.e., the Contractor keeps the deposit). [9][10][15]\n\n### c. Relationship to payment terms and deposit\n\n- The total contract price is **$29,900.00**, payable in **3 installments**:  \n  - **$20,000.00 upon signing**  \n  - **$7,000.00 upon delivery**  \n  - **$2,900.00 upon completion** [9][10][15]  \n- The \u201cdeposit\u201d referenced in the forfeiture clause is logically the **$20,000.00 upon signing**, which is the initial payment made when the contract becomes effective (\u201ceffective upon mutual signature and initial payment\u201d). [9][10][15]  \n- Thus, the **3 business days** cancellation right effectively governs whether that **$20,000.00** initial payment is fully refundable (if within 3 business days) or forfeited (if after 3 business days). [9][10][15]\n\n### d. No separate long\u2011term termination clause\n\n- Beyond the **3 business days** cancellation right and the general default clause (\u201cFailure to pay may result in legal action\u201d), the contract does **not** provide a general long\u2011term termination right (e.g., no \u201ceither party may terminate on 30 days\u2019 notice\u201d). [9][10][15]  \n- Termination/cancellation is therefore primarily governed by:\n  - The **3 business days** cancellation window with full refund vs. deposit forfeiture. [9][10][15]  \n  - Remedies for **Customer Default** (legal action, recovery of legal fees) rather than a mutual termination mechanism. [9][10][15]\n\n---\n\n## 5. contoso_lifts_invoice (Contoso Lifts LLC Invoice to Fabrikam Construction)\n\n- The invoice is a billing document showing an **INVOICE # 1256003**, total **$29,900.00**, and terms \u201cDue on contract signing,\u201d but it **does not contain any termination or cancellation clause.** [8]  \n- It references \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d which ties it conceptually to a contract, but the invoice itself has **no termination/cancellation mechanism, no notice period, and no refund/forfeiture rule.** [8]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross\u2011document connections and comparison\n\n### a. Shared parties and related obligations\n\n- **Contoso Ltd.** appears as:\n  - Buyer/Owner in the **Builders Limited Warranty** with Fabrikam Inc. (Builder). [1][5][11]  \n  - Owner in the **Property Management Agreement** with Walt Flood Realty. [4][7][13]  \n  - Holding Tank Owner in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** with Fabrikam Inc. (Pumper). [6][14]  \n- **Fabrikam Inc.** appears as:\n  - Builder in the **Builders Limited Warranty**. [1][5][11]  \n  - Pumper in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**. [6][14]  \n  - Customer in the **Purchase Contract** with Contoso Lifts LLC. [9][10][15]  \n- **Contoso Lifts LLC** appears as:\n  - Contractor in the **Purchase Contract**. [9][10][15]  \n  - Payee in the **contoso_lifts_invoice**. [8]\n\nThese relationships show that the same entities are subject to different termination/cancellation regimes across different contracts.\n\n### b. Summary of distinct notice periods and cancellation windows\n\nAcross all agreements, the explicit time\u2011based termination/cancellation rules are:\n\n1. **Builders Limited Warranty**  \n   - Coverage terminates after **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) days** from commencement, depending on the item. [2][3][5][11]  \n   - Warranty automatically terminates if the first purchaser **sells the home** or **moves out**. [1][2][3][5][11]  \n   - Arbitration provisions **survive any termination, amendment, or expiration** unless otherwise agreed in writing. [12]  \n   - **No refund/forfeiture rule** tied to cancellation. [1][2][3][5][11][12]\n\n2. **Property Management Agreement**  \n   - Either party may terminate on **sixty (60) days written notice**. [4][7][13]  \n   - Upon termination, Owner must still honor **all confirmed reservations** and remain responsible for obligations/expenses incurred by Agent. [4][7][13]  \n   - **No explicit refund/forfeiture rule** for any deposits or fees upon termination. [4][7][13]\n\n3. **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**  \n   - Agreement remains in effect until **owner or pumper terminates** (no specified notice period). [6][14]  \n   - Owner must file changes/new contract within **ten (10) business days** of any change to the service contract (administrative filing, not a termination notice period). [6][14]  \n   - **No cancellation window** and **no refund/forfeiture rule**. [6][14]\n\n4. **Purchase Contract (Contoso Lifts LLC)**  \n   - Customer may cancel within **3 business days** for **full refund**. [9][10][15]  \n   - If cancellation occurs **after 3 business days**, the **deposit is forfeited**. [9][10][15]  \n   - Total price **$29,900.00** with **$20,000.00 upon signing**, which functions as the deposit governed by this rule. [9][10][15]\n\n5. **contoso_lifts_invoice**  \n   - **No termination or cancellation mechanism** stated. [8]\n\n---\n\n### Direct answer to the query\n\nAcross the agreements:\n\n- **Termination by notice:**  \n  - Property Management Agreement: mutual termination on **60 days written notice**, with Owner still obligated to honor confirmed reservations and existing obligations. [4][7][13]  \n  - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: either party may terminate at any time (no notice period specified). [6][14]\n\n- **Automatic/structural termination:**  \n  - Builders Limited Warranty: coverage ends after **1 year** or **60 days** from commencement, and automatically terminates if the first purchaser sells or moves out; arbitration obligations survive termination. [1][2][3][5][11][12]\n\n- **Cancellation windows with refund/forfeiture:**  \n  - Purchase Contract (Contoso Lifts LLC): Customer may cancel within **3 business days** for **full refund**; if cancellation occurs after **3 business days**, the **deposit is forfeited**. [9][10][15]\n\n- **Documents with no termination/cancellation mechanism:**  \n  - contoso_lifts_invoice: contains **no termination or cancellation clause**. [8]",
            "text_norm": "below is a documentbydocument summary of all termination/cancellation rules with explicit notice periods cancellation windows and refund/forfeiture outcomes where stated. ---  1. builders limited warranty with arbitration fabrikam inc.  contoso ltd.  a. automatic termination by passage of time - the warranty coverage begins on the date of final settlement or the date when the buyer/owner first occupies the home whichever comes first. 123511 - the warranty terminates after either one 1 year or sixty 60 days depending on the specific coverage measured from that commencement date. 123511 - any claims not made in writing within the applicable one 1 year or sixty 60 day period are not covered any claims which have not been made in writing within one 1 year or sixty 60 as applicable are not covered. this functions as a timebased termination of coverage for unasserted claims. 23511  b. termination upon transfer of the home - the warranty is not transferable and is extended only to the first purchaser contoso ltd. as buyer/owner. 123511 - if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it the limited warranty automatically terminates. 123511  c. survival of arbitration provisions after termination - the arbitration program explicitly states that its provisions shall survive any termination amendment or expiration hereof or of the documents unless the parties otherwise expressly agree in writing. 12 - this means that even after the warranty itself terminates by time or by sale/moveout the obligation to arbitrate disputes continues unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. 12  d. no separate cancellation right / no refund rule - the warranty text does not provide a discretionary right to cancel by either party within a set number of days nor any refund/forfeiture rule tied to cancellation. it only provides: - timelimited coverage 1 year / 60 days. 23511 - automatic termination on sale/moveout. 123511 - therefore this document has termination rules timebased and transferbased but no explicit cancellation window with refund/forfeiture like the purchase contract below. ---  2. property management agreement short term/vacation rentals parties: contoso ltd. owner and walt flood realty agent  a. term and renewal - the agreement has an initial period of twelve months beginning on 2010-06-15. 4713 - it is automatically renewed for successive one year terms thereafter. 4713  b. sixty 60 days written notice termination right - either party may terminate the agreement upon sixty 60 days written notice. 4713 - this is a mutual termination right no cause is required in the text. 4713  c. effect of termination on existing rental agreements and obligations - existing rental agreements remain valid: termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by agent on owners behalf. 4713 - owner remains responsible for obligations/expenses incurred by agent: upon termination owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent. 4713  d. confirmed reservations must be honored after termination or sale - the agreement states: in the event this agreement is terminated or the property is sold the owner shall honor all confirmed reservations. 4713 - this creates a continuing obligation for contoso ltd. owner to honor reservations even after: - termination by 60 days written notice or - sale of the property. 4713  e. no explicit refund/forfeiture rule - the property management agreement does not specify any refund or deposit forfeiture mechanism tied to termination e.g. no clause saying the owner or agent must refund or may keep any particular deposit upon termination. 4713 - thus it has a sixty 60 days written notice termination mechanism but no explicit cancellation window with a refund/forfeiture outcome. 4713 ---  3. holding tank servicing contract parties: contoso ltd. owner and fabrikam inc. pumper  a. openended term with termination by either party - the contract states: this agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract. 614 - this creates an indefinite term that continues until either contoso ltd. owner or fabrikam inc. pumper chooses to terminate. 614  b. no specified notice period - the contract does not specify any notice period e.g. no 30 days or 60 days requirement for termination by either party. 614 - therefore there is a termination right but the timing and form of notice are not defined in the text. 614  c. obligation to file changes/new contract within 10 business days - if there is a change in this contract the owner must file a copy of any changes or a new service contract with the municipality and county within ten 10 business days from the date of change to this service contract. 614 - this 10 business days requirement is an administrative filing obligation triggered by a change which could include termination and replacement not a notice period for termination itself. 614  d. no cancellation window / no refund or forfeiture rule - the contract contains no right to cancel window e.g. no 3 business days or similar and no refund/forfeiture language regarding any deposit or prepayment. 614 - thus it has a termination right either party may terminate but no defined cancellation period or refund rule. 614 ---  4. purchase contract contoso lifts llc  fabrikam inc.  a. right to cancel  3 business days - the contract includes a specific right to cancel clause: customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. 91015 - this is an explicit 3 business days cancellation period during which the customer fabrikam inc. can cancel the contract. 91015  b. refund/forfeiture outcome tied to the cancellation window - the same clause states: afterward deposit is forfeited. 91015 - therefore: - if the customer cancels within 3 business days they receive a full refund. 91015 - if the customer cancels after 3 business days the deposit is forfeited i.e. the contractor keeps the deposit. 91015  c. relationship to payment terms and deposit - the total contract price is $29900.00 payable in 3 installments: - $20000.00 upon signing - $7000.00 upon delivery - $2900.00 upon completion 91015 - the deposit referenced in the forfeiture clause is logically the $20000.00 upon signing which is the initial payment made when the contract becomes effective effective upon mutual signature and initial payment. 91015 - thus the 3 business days cancellation right effectively governs whether that $20000.00 initial payment is fully refundable if within 3 business days or forfeited if after 3 business days. 91015  d. no separate longterm termination clause - beyond the 3 business days cancellation right and the general default clause failure to pay may result in legal action the contract does not provide a general longterm termination right e.g. no either party may terminate on 30 days notice. 91015 - termination/cancellation is therefore primarily governed by: - the 3 business days cancellation window with full refund vs. deposit forfeiture. 91015 - remedies for customer default legal action recovery of legal fees rather than a mutual termination mechanism. 91015 ---  5. contosoliftsinvoice contoso lifts llc invoice to fabrikam construction - the invoice is a billing document showing an invoice  1256003 total $29900.00 and terms due on contract signing but it does not contain any termination or cancellation clause. 8 - it references initial payment in accordance with contract which ties it conceptually to a contract but the invoice itself has no termination/cancellation mechanism no notice period and no refund/forfeiture rule. 8 ---  6. crossdocument connections and comparison  a. shared parties and related obligations - contoso ltd. appears as: - buyer/owner in the builders limited warranty with fabrikam inc. builder. 1511 - owner in the property management agreement with walt flood realty. 4713 - holding tank owner in the holding tank servicing contract with fabrikam inc. pumper. 614 - fabrikam inc. appears as: - builder in the builders limited warranty. 1511 - pumper in the holding tank servicing contract. 614 - customer in the purchase contract with contoso lifts llc. 91015 - contoso lifts llc appears as: - contractor in the purchase contract. 91015 - payee in the contosoliftsinvoice. 8 these relationships show that the same entities are subject to different termination/cancellation regimes across different contracts.  b. summary of distinct notice periods and cancellation windows across all agreements the explicit timebased termination/cancellation rules are: 1. builders limited warranty - coverage terminates after one 1 year or sixty 60 days from commencement depending on the item. 23511 - warranty automatically terminates if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out. 123511 - arbitration provisions survive any termination amendment or expiration unless otherwise agreed in writing. 12 -

            "text": "Below is a document-by-document summary of all **termination / cancellation** rules, with explicit notice periods, cancellation windows, and refund/forfeiture outcomes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Builders Limited Warranty (Fabrikam Inc. \u2194 Contoso Ltd.)\n\n**a. Automatic termination by passage of time**\n\n- The warranty coverage begins on the **date of final settlement** or the date when the **Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**, whichever comes first. [2][3][5][11]  \n- The warranty **terminates** after either:\n  - **one (1) year** for the one\u2011year coverages, or  \n  - **sixty (60) days** for the 60\u2011day coverages,  \n  measured from commencement. [2][3][5][11]  \n- Any claims **not made in writing** within the applicable **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) day** period are **not covered** (\u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING \u2026 WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d). [2][3][5][11]\n\n**b. Termination upon transfer of the home**\n\n- The warranty is **not transferable** and is extended only to the **Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home**. [2][3][5][11]  \n- If the **first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it**, the limited warranty **automatically terminates**. [2][3][5][11]\n\n**c. Arbitration program survival after termination**\n\n- The **Arbitration Program provisions** expressly **survive any termination, amendment, or expiration** of the warranty or related \u201cDocuments,\u201d unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. [12]  \n- This means that even after the warranty term ends or the warranty is otherwise terminated, the arbitration clause remains in effect unless both parties agree in writing to change that. [12]\n\n**d. No separate \u201ccancellation\u201d right**\n\n- There is **no explicit customer or builder right to cancel** the warranty at will; termination is tied to:\n  - expiration of the **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) day** term, [2][3][5][11] and  \n  - sale of the home or the first purchaser moving out. [2][3][5][11]  \n- The documents do **not** specify any refund or forfeiture mechanism upon termination; they only state that claims outside the term are not covered. [2][3][5][11]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Property Management Agreement (Contoso Ltd. \u2194 Walt Flood Realty)\n\n**a. Term and renewal**\n\n- The agreement has an **initial period of twelve months** beginning on **2010-06-15** and is **automatically renewed for successive one year terms** thereafter. [4][7][13]\n\n**b. Sixty (60) days written notice termination right**\n\n- **Either party** (Owner or Agent) may **terminate** the agreement **upon sixty (60) days written notice**. [4][7][13]  \n- This is a clear **\u201c60 days written notice\u201d termination right** for both sides. [4][7][13]\n\n**c. Effect of termination on existing rental agreements**\n\n- **Termination does not invalidate any existing rental agreements** made by the Agent on the Owner\u2019s behalf. [4][7][13]  \n- Upon termination, the **Owner shall continue to be responsible** or shall cause to be completed **all obligations or expenses incurred** under the agreement by the Agent. [4][7][13]\n\n**d. Confirmed reservations must be honored after termination or sale**\n\n- If the agreement is **terminated**, or if the **property is sold**, the **Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations**. [4][13]  \n- This creates a continuing obligation that survives termination or sale with respect to already confirmed bookings. [4][13]\n\n**e. Refund / forfeiture**\n\n- The agreement **does not specify** any refund or forfeiture of fees or commissions upon termination. It only addresses ongoing responsibility for obligations and honoring reservations. [4][7][13]\n\n---\n\n## 3. Holding Tank Servicing Contract (Contoso Ltd. \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\n**a. Open-ended term with termination by either party**\n\n- The contract states: \u201cThis agreement will remain in effect **until the owner or pumper terminates this contract**.\u201d [6][14]  \n- This gives **both the owner and the pumper** a right to terminate, but **no specific notice period** (e.g., days) is stated. [6][14]\n\n**b. Obligations upon change/termination**\n\n- In the event of a **change in this contract**, the owner agrees to **file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract** with the municipality and the County within **ten (10) business days** from the date of change. [6][14]  \n- While this \u201cten (10) business days\u201d requirement is framed around **changes** or a **new service contract**, it effectively governs the owner\u2019s obligation to notify authorities when the service arrangement is altered or replaced, which would typically occur upon termination or replacement of the pumper. [6][14]\n\n**c. Refund / forfeiture**\n\n- The contract **does not mention** any refund or forfeiture of payments upon termination. [6][14]\n\n---\n\n## 4. Purchase Contract for Lift (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\n**a. Right to cancel \u2013 3 business days cancellation period**\n\n- The contract includes a **\u201cRight to Cancel\u201d** clause:  \n  - The **Customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund**. [9][10][15]  \n  - This is an explicit **\u201c3 business days\u201d cancellation period**. [9][10][15]\n\n**b. Deposit forfeiture after cancellation period**\n\n- The same clause states that **afterward, deposit is forfeited**. [9][10][15]  \n- Thus:\n  - If the Customer cancels **within 3 business days**, they receive a **full refund** of the deposit. [9][10][15]  \n  - If the Customer cancels **after 3 business days**, the **deposit is forfeited** (i.e., not refunded). [9][10][15]\n\n**c. Contract effectiveness**\n\n- The contract is **effective upon mutual signature and initial payment**, meaning the cancellation right operates after the contract has become effective. [9][10][15]\n\n**d. No separate long-term termination clause**\n\n- Beyond the **3 business days** cancellation right and deposit forfeiture rule, the contract does **not provide a general at\u2011will termination right** for either party later in the project. [9][10][15]  \n- Other clauses address **customer default** (failure to pay may result in legal action and recovery of legal fees) but do not create a separate termination window with refunds. [9][10][15]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Contoso Lifts LLC Invoice\n\n- The **invoice** from Contoso Lifts LLC is a billing document and **does not contain any termination or cancellation mechanism**. It lists items, prices, and payment terms (\u201cDue on contract signing\u201d) but no cancellation rights or notice periods. [8]  \n- Therefore, **no termination/cancellation rules are present in the invoice itself**. [8]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross-Document Observations and Connections\n\n**a. Different types of termination/cancellation mechanisms**\n\n- **Time-based warranty expiration**:  \n  - Builders Limited Warranty terminates after **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) days**, depending on the coverage, and is non-transferable; it also terminates automatically if the first purchaser sells or moves out. [2][3][5][11]\n- **Notice-based contract termination**:  \n  - Property Management Agreement allows either party to terminate with **sixty (60) days written notice**, while preserving existing rental agreements and requiring the Owner to honor confirmed reservations. [4][7][13]\n- **Open-ended service contract termination**:  \n  - Holding Tank Servicing Contract remains in effect until either the **owner or pumper terminates**, with no specified notice period, but requires filing changes or a new contract with authorities within **ten (10) business days**. [6][14]\n- **Short cancellation window with deposit consequences**:  \n  - Purchase Contract for the lift gives the Customer **3 business days** to cancel for a **full refund**, after which the **deposit is forfeited**. [9][10][15]\n\n**b. Refund / forfeiture outcomes summarized**\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty**:  \n  - No explicit refund or forfeiture rules; termination affects coverage, not payments. [2][3][5][11]\n- **Property Management Agreement**:  \n  - No explicit refund/forfeiture; termination preserves existing rental obligations and confirmed reservations. [4][7][13]\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:  \n  - No refund/forfeiture language; only ongoing service and reporting obligations plus filing changes within **ten (10) business days**. [6][14]\n- **Purchase Contract (Lift)**:  \n  - **Within 3 business days**: **full refund**. [9][10][15]  \n  - **After 3 business days**: **deposit is forfeited**. [9][10][15]\n\n**c. Entities and relationships**\n\n- **Contoso Ltd.** appears as:\n  - Buyer/Owner in the **Builders Limited Warranty** with Fabrikam Inc. [1][5][11]  \n  - Property Owner in the **Property Management Agreement** with Walt Flood Realty. [4][7][13]  \n  - Holding Tank Owner in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** with Fabrikam Inc. [6][14]  \n- **Contoso Lifts LLC** is the Contractor in the **Purchase Contract** and issuer of the related **invoice**, but only the Purchase Contract contains cancellation rules. [8][9][10][15]  \n- The **Arbitration Program** in the Builders Limited Warranty explicitly survives **termination, amendment, or expiration**, showing that some dispute-resolution obligations continue even after the main warranty term ends. [12]\n\n---\n\n### Consolidated List of Distinct Notice Periods / Cancellation Windows\n\n- **\u201cone (1) year\u201d** warranty term (Builders Limited Warranty). [2][3][5][11]  \n- **\u201csixty (60) days\u201d** warranty term for certain items (Builders Limited Warranty). [2][3][5][11]  \n- **Automatic termination upon sale or move-out by first purchaser** (Builders Limited Warranty). [2][3][5][11]  \n- **\u201csixty (60) days written notice\u201d** termination right for either party (Property Management Agreement). [4][7][13]  \n- **\u201cten (10) business days\u201d** to file changes or a new service contract with municipality and County after a change in the service contract (Holding Tank Servicing Contract). [6][14]  \n- **\u201c3 business days\u201d** cancellation period for full refund; **afterward, deposit is forfeited** (Purchase Contract for lift). [9][10][15]",

Automatic Termination by Passage of Time\n\n- The warranty coverage begins on the **date of final settlement** or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, **whichever comes first**. [1][2][3][5][11]  \n- The warranty **terminates** after either:\n  - **1 year** for the one\u2011year coverages, or  \n  - **60 days** for the sixty\u2011day coverages,  \n  measured from commencement. [1][2][3][5][11]  \n- Any claims **not made in writing** within the applicable **1 year** or **60 days** period are **not covered** (\u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING \u2026 WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d). This functions as a termination of claim rights after those periods.

[1][2][3][5][11]\n\n### 1.3. Arbitration Program \u2013 Survival After Termination\n\n- The arbitration provisions explicitly state that the **\u201cprovisions of this Arbitration Program shall survive any termination, amendment, or expiration hereof or of the Documents unless the Parties otherwise expressly agree in writing.\u201d** [12]  \n- \u201cDocuments\u201d include the warranty and related agreements. [1][12]\n\n**Effect:** Even if the warranty terminates (by time lapse, sale, or moving out), the arbitration clause continues to apply to disputes unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. [12]\n\n### 1.4. No Separate Early Termination Right\n\n- There is **no clause** granting either party a general right to terminate the warranty early by notice (e.g., no \u201c60 days written notice\u201d termination right in this document). [1][2][3][5][11][12]  \n- Termination mechanisms are limited to:\n  - Expiry after **1 year** or **60 days**, and  \n  - Automatic termination upon sale or move\u2011out by the first purchaser.

Sixty (60) Days Written Notice Termination Right\n\n- Either party may terminate:  \n  - \u201cHowever, either party upon **sixty (60) days written notice** may terminate this agreement.\u201d [4][7][13]\n\n**Effect:** Both Owner (Contoso Ltd.) and Agent (Walt Flood Realty) have a mutual right to terminate at any time, provided they give **60 days written notice**. [4][7][13]\n\n### 2.3. Obligations Surviving Termination\n\n- Termination **does not invalidate any existing rental agreements** made by Agent on Owner\u2019s behalf. [4][7][13]  \n- Upon termination, Owner must **continue to be responsible** or cause to be completed **all obligations or expenses incurred** by the Agent under the agreement. [4][7][13]  \n- If the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, the Owner **\u201cshall honor all confirmed reservations.\u201d** [4][7][13]\n\n**Effect:**  \n- Even after termination by **60 days written notice**, the Owner must:\n  - Honor all **confirmed reservations**, and  \n  - Pay or complete all obligations/expenses already incurred by the Agent. [4][7][13]\n\n### 2.4. No Refund / Forfeiture Rule Stated\n\n- The agreement does **not** specify any **refund** or **deposit forfeiture** mechanism tied to termination.

[6][14]\n\n**Effect:** Either party (Owner: Contoso Ltd.; Pumper: Fabrikam Inc.) may terminate at any time, but the contract does not specify a required notice period or form (written/oral). [6][14]\n\n### 3.2. Post\u2011Termination Filing Requirement\n\n- In the event of a **change in this contract**, the owner agrees to file:\n  - A copy of any changes to this service contract, or  \n  - A copy of a new service contract  \n  with the municipality and the County within **ten (10) business days** from the date of change. [6][14]\n\n**Connection to Termination:**  \n- Termination is a \u201cchange in this contract,\u201d so when the owner changes or replaces the service contract (including by termination and entering a new one), the owner must file the updated or new contract within **10 business days**. [6][14]\n\n### 3.3. No Refund / Forfeiture Rule Stated\n\n- The contract does **not** specify any **refund** or **deposit forfeiture** terms upon termination. [6][14]  \n- Payment is described as \u201ccharges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon,\u201d but no cancellation\u2011specific financial consequence is given.

Right to Cancel \u2013 3 Business Days Cancellation Period\n\n- The contract includes a **\u201cRight to Cancel\u201d** clause:  \n  - \u201cCustomer may cancel within **3 business days** for full refund.\u201d [9][10][15]  \n- This is an explicit **3 business days cancellation period** from the effective date (mutual signature and initial payment). [9][10][15]\n\n**Refund Outcome:**  \n- If the customer cancels within **3 business days**, they receive a **full refund**. [9][10][15]\n\n### 4.2. Deposit Forfeiture After Cancellation Period\n\n- The same clause continues: **\u201cAfterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d** [9][10][15]  \n- \u201cDeposit\u201d refers to the initial payment, which is **$20,000.00 upon signing** as part of the total contract price of **$29,900.00**. [9][10][15]\n\n**Effect:**  \n- Cancellation **after** the **3 business days** window is still allowed, but the **deposit is forfeited**; the customer does not get the initial payment back. [9][10][15]\n\n### 4.3. No Other Termination Mechanism Stated\n\n- Apart from the **3 business days** right to cancel and the forfeiture rule after that period, the contract does **not** provide:\n  - A general right for either party to terminate on notice (e.g., no \u201c60 days written notice\u201d clause). [9][10][15]  \n- Other sections (Scope of Work, Payment Terms, Customer Default, Risk of Loss, Delivery, Applicable Law, Assignment, Warranty, Permitting) do not introduce additional termination or cancellation rights. [9][10][15]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Contoso Lifts LLC Invoice\n\n**Document:** contoso_lifts_invoice [8]\n\n- The invoice is a billing document and **does not contain any termination or cancellation mechanism**. [8]  \n- It references \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d and \u201cDue on contract signing,\u201d but all cancellation/termination rules are in the separate **Purchase Contract**, not in the invoice itself. [8][9][10][15]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross\u2011Document Connections and Entity Relationships\n\n### 6.1. Contoso Ltd.

[1][5][11]  \n  - Property Owner in the **Property Management Agreement** with Walt Flood Realty. [4][7][13]  \n  - Holding Tank Owner in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** with Fabrikam Inc. as Pumper. [6][14]\n\nAcross these:\n\n- In the **warranty**, Contoso Ltd.\u2019s rights terminate automatically after **1 year** or **60 days**, or upon sale/move\u2011out; arbitration survives termination.

[8]\n\nThe **3 business days cancellation period** and **deposit forfeiture** rules are defined in the **Purchase Contract**, not in the invoice. [9][10][15]  \nThe invoice simply references that payment is \u201cDue on contract signing,\u201d aligning with the **$20,000.00 upon signing** deposit that is subject to forfeiture if cancellation occurs after the **3 business days** window. [8][9][10][15]\n\n### 6.3. Arbitration Survival vs. Agreement Termination\n\n- The **Builders Limited Warranty** explicitly states that the **Arbitration Program** provisions **survive any termination, amendment, or expiration** of the warranty or related documents unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. [12]  \n- This is a different pattern from the other agreements, which do not explicitly address survival of dispute resolution clauses after termination. [4][6][9][10][13][14][15]\n\n---\n\n## 7.

[15][16][17]\n\nThe contract does not assign specific fees or taxes to these self\u2011help remedies, but any **claim or Dispute related to exercise of any self\u2011help, auxiliary or other rights** is itself a \u201cDispute\u201d subject to the arbitration program (and thus the \u00bd\u2011and\u2011\u00bd cost split and potential sanctions described above). [15][16][17]\n\n---\n\n## 3. Holding Tank Servicing Contract (septic/holding tank service)\n\n**Parties:**  \n- Holding Tank Owner: Contoso Ltd. [8][10]  \n- Pumper: Fabrikam Inc. [8][10]\n\n### 3.1.

Risk of loss and compliance costs\n\n1. **Risk of loss**  \n   - Contractor holds risk until delivery; Customer holds risk thereafter.

Contoso Lifts Invoice #1256003 (equipment invoice)\n\n**Issuer:** Contoso Lifts LLC (same entity as Contractor in the purchase contract) [11][14]  \n**Customer:** John Doe / Fabrikam Construction [11][14]\n\n### 5.1. Line items and who pays\n\nThe invoice lists quantities, descriptions, and prices, with a **SUBTOTAL of 29900.00**, **TAX N/A**, and **TOTAL 29900.00**, with **AMOUNT DUE 29900.00**. [11][14]\n\nLine items (all payable by the invoice recipient, John Doe / Fabrikam Construction):\n\n- 1 Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504) \u2013 **11200.00**. [11][14]  \n- 1 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts \u2013 **3000.00**. [11][14]  \n- 1 Special Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3 \u2013 **5800.00**. [11][14]  \n- 1 Outdoor fitting \u2013 **2000.00**. [11][14]  \n- 1 80\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi\u2011glass inserts, WR\u2011500 lock, automatic door operator \u2013 **5000.00**. [11][14]  \n- 2 Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing at **1450.00** each, total **2900.00**. [11][14]\n\nTotals:\n\n- **SUBTOTAL 29900.00**. [11][14]  \n- **TAX N/A** (no tax charged on this invoice). [11][14]  \n- **TOTAL 29900.00**. [11][14]  \n- **AMOUNT DUE 29900.00**. [11][14]\n\nThe invoice states \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d and \u201cDue on contract signing,\u201d indicating this amount is due from the customer at contract signing. [11][14]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross\u2011document connections and \u201cwho pays what\u201d across entities\n\n### 6.1. Hawaii Gross Excise Tax vs. other taxes\n\n- In the **Property Management Agreement**, the Agent explicitly charges the Owner **Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%)** on all Agent\u2019s fees, commissions, and charges. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n- In the **Contoso Lifts invoice**, tax is listed as **\u201cTAX N/A\u201d**, so no sales or excise tax is charged on that invoice. [11][14]  \n- The **Purchase Contract** for the lift does not separately mention sales tax or excise tax; it only states the total contract price of **$29,900.00** and the installment schedule. [12][13]  \n  \u2192 Thus, only the Hawaii property management context explicitly passes a tax (Hawaii Gross Excise tax at 4.712%) through to the paying party (Owner). [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n### 6.2. Self\u2011help remedies and arbitrator sanctions (Builder\u2019s warranty)\n\n- The **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty** preserves **self\u2011help remedies (including repossession and set\u2011off rights)** for any party, without specifying separate fees for exercising them. [15][16][17]  \n- Any dispute about these self\u2011help actions is arbitrated, with each party paying **\u00bd of arbitration costs** and its own attorneys\u2019 fees, and with arbitrators empowered to impose sanctions for delay. [15][16][17]  \n- If a party refuses arbitration after a lawful demand, that party must pay **all costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees** incurred by the other party to compel arbitration. [7][9]\n\n### 6.3. Agent\u2019s fees vs. Contractor\u2019s fees vs. Service charges\n\n- **Agent\u2019s fees (Hawaii property management):**  \n  - Paid by Owner (Contoso Ltd.) to Agent (Walt Flood Realty), including percentage commissions, monthly charges, hourly charges, and Hawaii Gross Excise tax at 4.712%.

Property Management Agreement (Hawaii rental property)\n\n**Parties:**  \n- Owner: Contoso Ltd. (\u201cOwner\u201d)  \n- Agent: Walt Flood Realty (\u201cAgent\u201d) [1][4]\n\n### 1.1. Agent\u2019s fees and who pays them\n\nAll listed fees and charges are **paid by the Owner to the Agent**; the Owner \u201cis advised and agrees to pay the following\u201d Agent\u2019s fees. [2][3][5][6]\n\n1. **Credit card / bankcard fees**  \n   - Agent is allowed to accept credit cards and **deduct credit card and/or bankcard fees from the Owner\u2019s proceeds**.  \n   - Economic burden: Owner (via reduction of Owner\u2019s rental proceeds). [2][3][5][6]\n\n2. **Management commission \u2013 short\u2011term/vacation rentals**  \n   - **\u201cA fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).\u201d** [2][3][5][6]  \n   - Payer: Owner. [2][3][5][6]\n\n3. **Management commission \u2013 long\u2011term leases**  \n   - **\u201cA fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).\u201d** [2][3][5][6]  \n   - Payer: Owner. [2][3][5][6]\n\n4. **Advertising pro\u2011ration charge (short\u2011term rentals)**  \n   - **\u201cA pro-ration charge for advertising for short-term (vacation rentals), at $75.00/month.\u201d** [2][3][5][6]  \n   - Payer: Owner. [2][3][5][6]\n\n5. **Administration and accounting minimum charge**  \n   - **\u201cA minimum charge for administration and accounting, at $50.00/month (not to include tax preparation/returns/forms).\u201d** [2][3][5][6]  \n   - Payer: Owner. [2][3][5][6]\n\n6. **Fee on repairs, upgrades, renovations**  \n   - **\u201cA fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.\u201d** [2][3][5][6]  \n   - Payer: Owner. [2][3][5][6]\n\n7. **Hourly charge for scheduling/escorting contractors**  \n   - **\u201cA charge of $35/hour to schedule repairs, upgrades, renovations, replacement of appliances, carpets, curtains, drapes, and/or to escort the contractors, repair persons, technicians and handymen.\u201d** [2][3][5][6]  \n   - Payer: Owner. [2][3][5][6]\n\n8. **Agency start\u2011up fee**  \n   - **\u201cUpon the execution of this Agreement, the Owner shall pay two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the Agent as a non-refundable start-up fee.\u201d** [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n   - Payer: Owner. [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n### 1.2. Hawaii Gross Excise Tax \u2013 who pays and on what\n\n- The Agreement states: **\u201cPlus, the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.\u201d** [2][3][4][5][6]  \n- **Tax rate:** \u201c4.712%\u201d (explicitly stated). [4][5][6]  \n- **Tax base:** \u201call the above fees, commissions and charges\u201d (i.e., all Agent\u2019s fees listed in (a)\u2013(g)). [2][3][4][5][6]  \n- **Who pays:** The Owner, because the Agent \u201cwill assess/charge the Owner\u201d this tax. [2][3][4][5][6]\n\n### 1.3. Other Owner\u2011borne obligations (non\u2011fee but economic responsibilities)\n\n- Owner must **provide Agent with Owner\u2019s General Excise Tax License** (indicating Owner is responsible for its own general excise tax compliance). [4]  \n- Owner must **provide liability insurance** with minimum limits of **$300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others**, naming Agent as additional insured. [4]  \n- Owner must **honor all confirmed reservations** even if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, and must remain responsible for obligations/expenses incurred by Agent before termination. [4]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty with Arbitration (Idaho home)\n\n**Parties:**  \n- Builder: Fabrikam Inc. (\u201cBuilder\u201d) [7][9]  \n- Buyer/Owner: Contoso Ltd. (\u201cBuyer/Owner\u201d) [7][9]\n\n### 2.1. Arbitration costs and arbitrator sanctions \u2013 who pays what\n\nUnder the arbitration program:\n\n1. **Baseline allocation of arbitration costs**  \n   - **\u201cEach party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration and their respective costs including attorneys' fees in any arbitration.\u201d** [15][16][17]  \n   - So, **each party pays 50% of the arbitration forum\u2019s costs and fees**, and each party also pays its own attorneys\u2019 fees and other costs. [15][16][17]\n\n2. **Arbitrator sanctions**  \n   - The arbitrator(s) **\u201cshall be empowered to impose sanctions for any Party's failure to proceed within the times established herein.\u201d** [15][16][17]  \n   - The clause does not specify a fixed amount or which party ultimately bears the monetary impact; it authorizes the arbitrator to impose sanctions, which typically fall on the non\u2011complying party. The factual claim here is only that the arbitrator can impose sanctions for delay. [15][16][17]\n\n3. **Costs when a party refuses to arbitrate after a lawful demand**  \n   - If a party fails to submit to arbitration after a lawful demand, **\u201cAny Party who fails to submit to binding arbitration following a lawful demand by another Party shall bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, (including those incurred in any trial, bankruptcy proceeding or on appeal) incurred by the other Party in obtaining a stay of any pending judicial proceeding and compelling arbitration of any Dispute.\u201d** [7][9]  \n   - So, the **non\u2011complying party pays all such costs and the other party\u2019s reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees** for compelling arbitration. [7][9]\n\n### 2.2. Self\u2011help remedies \u2013 who bears costs/risks\n\nThe arbitration clause preserves certain remedies:\n\n- Parties retain the right to **\u201cexercise self-help remedies (including repossession and set-off rights)\u201d** and to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as **injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim & delivery, replevin, garnishment, or appointment of a receiver** from a court. [15][16][17]  \n- The clause does not assign specific fees or taxes to these self\u2011help remedies; it only states that exercising them **\u201cshall not constitute a waiver of the right of any Party to Arbitration\u201d** and that any claim or dispute related to such exercise is itself a \u201cDispute\u201d under the arbitration program. [15][16][17]  \n- Thus, **no explicit fee schedule or tax allocation is attached to self\u2011help remedies** in the text; costs would follow general law and court/arbitration decisions, not a fixed contractual \u201cwho pays what\u201d schedule. [15][16][17]\n\n---\n\n## 3. Holding Tank Servicing Contract (Wisconsin)\n\n**Parties:**  \n- Holding Tank Owner: Contoso Ltd. [8][10]  \n- Pumper: Fabrikam Inc. [8][10]\n\n### 3.1. Service charges \u2013 who pays what\n\n- The Owner **\u201cagrees to have the holding tank(s) serviced by the pumper\u201d** and **\u201cfurther agrees to pay the pumper for a charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.\u201d** [8][10]  \n- The contract does **not specify numeric service fees or tax rates**, only that the Owner pays whatever charges are mutually agreed. [8][10]  \n- Therefore, **all servicing charges are borne by the Owner and paid to the Pumper**, with amounts determined separately. [8][10]\n\n### 3.2. Reporting obligations \u2013 who bears administrative burden\n\n- The Pumper **\u201cagrees to submit to the County, reports for the servicing of the holding tank(s) in manner specified by the County\u201d** and must include specified information (responsible person, owner, location, permit number, service dates, volumes pumped, disposal sites, and condition of tank/components). [8][10]  \n- No explicit fee or tax is attached to this reporting obligation in the contract; it is an administrative duty of the Pumper. [8][10]\n\n---\n\n## 4. Elevator/Lift Purchase Contract (Florida) \u2013 Contoso Lifts LLC & Fabrikam Inc.\n\n**Parties:**  \n- Contractor: Contoso Lifts LLC [12][13]  \n- Customer: Fabrikam Inc. [12][13]\n\n### 4.1. Contract price and payment schedule \u2013 who pays what\n\n- **Total contract price:** **\u201c$29,900.00\u201d**. [12][13]  \n- **Payment terms:** **\u201cpayable in 3 installments\u201d**:  \n  - **\u201c$20,000.00 upon signing\u201d** [12][13]  \n  - **\u201c$7,000.00 upon delivery\u201d** [12][13]  \n  - **\u201c$2,900.00 upon completion\u201d** [12][13]  \n- Payer: Fabrikam Inc. (Customer) pays these amounts to Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor). [12][13]\n\n### 4.2. Legal fees on customer default\n\n- Under \u201cCustomer Default\u201d: **\u201cFailure to pay may result in legal action. Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.\u201d** [12][13]  \n- This means that if Fabrikam Inc. fails to pay and Contoso Lifts LLC takes legal action, **Fabrikam Inc. can be required to pay the Contractor\u2019s legal fees**, in addition to the contract price, as recoverable costs. [12][13]\n\n### 4.3. Permitting and compliance costs\n\n- Under \u201cPermitting\u201d: **\u201cContractor assists with permitting. Customer bears any additional compliance costs.\u201d** [12][13]  \n- So, **any additional compliance costs (e.g., extra permitting or code\u2011related expenses) are paid by the Customer (Fabrikam Inc.)**, not by the Contractor. [12][13]\n\n### 4.4. Right to cancel and deposit forfeiture\n\n- Under \u201cRight to Cancel\u201d: **\u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d** [12][13]  \n- This implies:  \n  - If Fabrikam Inc. cancels within 3 business days, it receives a **full refund** of amounts paid. [12][13]  \n  - If cancellation occurs after 3 business days, **the deposit (initial payment) is forfeited**, meaning Fabrikam Inc. bears that cost and Contoso Lifts LLC keeps the deposit. [12][13]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Contoso Lifts LLC Invoice #1256003 (equipment sale)\n\n**Parties:**  \n- Seller: Contoso Lifts LLC [11][14]  \n- Customer: John Doe / Fabrikam Construction [11][14]\n\n### 5.1. Line\u2011item charges \u2013 who pays what\n\nThe invoice lists equipment and services with unit prices and totals, leading to a subtotal and total:\n\n- Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504): **$11,200.00** (quantity 1, total **$11,200.00**) [11][14]  \n- 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts: **$3,000.00** (quantity 1, total **$3,000.00**) [11][14]  \n- Special Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3: **$5,800.00** (quantity 1, total **$5,800.00**) [11][14]  \n- Outdoor fitting: **$2,000.00** (quantity 1, total **$2,000.00**) [11][14]  \n- 80\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts, WR-500 lock, automatic door operator: **$5,000.00** (quantity 1, total **$5,000.00**) [11][14]  \n- Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing: **$1,450.00** each, quantity 2, total **$2,900.00** [11][14]  \n\n**Subtotal:** **$29,900.00** [11][14]  \n**TAX:** \u201cN/A\u201d [11][14]  \n**TOTAL:** **$29,900.00** [11][14]  \n**AMOUNT DUE:** **$29,900.00** [11][14]\n\n- Payer: The **Customer (John Doe / Fabrikam Construction)** is responsible for paying the **Amount Due of $29,900.00** to Contoso Lifts LLC. [11][14]  \n- The invoice explicitly shows **\u201cTAX N/A\u201d**, so **no sales tax is being charged on this invoice**; the customer pays only the subtotal/total of **$29,900.00**. [11][14]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross\u2011document connections and \u201cwho pays what\u201d themes\n\n### 6.1. Agent\u2019s fees and Hawaii Gross Excise Tax vs. other tax treatments\n\n- In the **Property Management Agreement**, the Agent explicitly passes through the **Hawaii Gross Excise tax at 4.712%** on all its fees, commissions, and charges, and the **Owner pays this tax**. [2][3][4][5][6]  \n- In contrast, the **Contoso Lifts invoice** explicitly lists **\u201cTAX N/A\u201d**, so **no tax is charged to the customer on that invoice**. [11][14]  \n- The **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** and **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty** do not specify any tax rates or explicit tax pass\u2011throughs; they focus on service charges and arbitration costs, respectively. [8][10][7][9][15][16][17]\n\n### 6.2. Self\u2011help remedies and arbitrator sanctions vs. fee schedules\n\n- The **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty** arbitration program preserves **self-help remedies** (including repossession and set\u2011off) and allows parties to seek provisional remedies in court, but it does **not attach specific fees or taxes** to those remedies; instead, it defines them as rights that can be exercised without waiving arbitration. [15][16][17]  \n- The same arbitration program explicitly allocates **arbitration costs 50/50** and allows the arbitrator to **impose sanctions** for delay, but again without a fixed dollar schedule. [15][16][17]  \n- By contrast, the **Property Management Agreement** provides a detailed **fee schedule with percentages and fixed dollar amounts** and explicitly adds a **4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax** on those fees, all paid by the Owner. [2][3][4][5][6]\n\n### 6.3. Legal fees and enforcement costs\n\n- In the **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty**, a party who refuses to arbitrate after a lawful demand must **bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees** incurred by the other party to compel arbitration. [7][9]  \n- In the **Purchase Contract** for the lift, if the Customer fails to pay, **\u201cLegal fees are recoverable by Contractor\u201d**, meaning the Customer can be required to pay the Contractor\u2019s legal fees in a default scenario. [12][13]  \n- These provisions show a consistent pattern: **the non\u2011complying or defaulting party bears the other side\u2019s enforcement/legal costs** in both the Idaho warranty and the Florida purchase contract. [7][9][12][13]\n\n---\n\n### Consolidated \u201cWho Pays What\u201d Snapshot\n\n- **Property Management Agreement (Hawaii):**  \n  - Owner (Contoso Ltd.) pays:  \n    - 25% of gross revenues for short\u2011term management [2][3][5][6]  \n    - 10% of gross revenues for long\u2011term management [2][3][5][6]  \n    - $75.00/month advertising (short\u2011term) [2][3][5][6]  \n    - $50.00/month admin/accounting minimum [2][3][5][6]  \n    - 10% fee on repairs/upgrades/renovations [2][3][5][6]  \n    - $35/hour scheduling/escort charge [2][3][5][6]  \n    - $250.00 non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n    - Hawaii Gross Excise tax at 4.712% on all above fees/charges [2][3][4][5][6]\n\n- **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty (Idaho):**  \n  - Each party pays 1/2 of arbitration costs and its own attorneys\u2019 fees in arbitration.

[8][10]\n\n- **Lift Purchase Contract (Florida):**  \n  - Customer (Fabrikam Inc.) pays total contract price of $29,900.00 in three installments: $20,000.00 on signing, $7,000.00 on delivery, $2,900.00 on completion. [12][13]  \n  - On default, Customer may be required to pay Contractor\u2019s legal fees. [12][13]  \n  - Customer bears any additional compliance costs related to permitting. [12][13]  \n  - If Customer cancels after 3 business days, deposit is forfeited (Customer bears that cost). [12][13]\n\n- **Contoso Lifts Invoice #1256003:**  \n  - Customer (John Doe / Fabrikam Construction) owes $29,900.00 (subtotal = total) with **TAX N/A**, so no tax is charged on the invoice.

if a party fails to submit to arbitration after a lawful demand any party who fails to submit to binding arbitration following a lawful demand by another party shall bear all costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees including those incurred in any trial bankruptcy proceeding or on appeal incurred by the other party in obtaining a stay of any pending judicial proceeding and compelling arbitration of any dispute. 79 -

parties retain the right to exercise self-help remedies including repossession and set-off rights and to obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as injunctive relief sequestration attachment claim  delivery replevin garnishment or appointment of a receiver from a court. 151617 - the clause does not assign specific fees or taxes to these selfhelp remedies it only states that exercising them shall not constitute a waiver of the right of any party to arbitration and that any claim or dispute related to such exercise is itself a dispute under the arbitration program. 151617 - thus no explicit fee schedule or tax allocation is attached to selfhelp remedies in the text costs would follow general law and court/arbitration decisions not a fixed contractual who pays what schedule. 151617 ---  3. holding tank servicing contract wisconsin parties: -

under permitting: contractor assists with permitting. customer bears any additional compliance costs. 1213 - so any additional compliance costs e.g. extra permitting or coderelated expenses are paid by the customer fabrikam inc. not by the contractor. 1213  4.4. right to cancel and deposit forfeiture -

in the property management agreement the agent explicitly passes through the hawaii gross excise tax at 4.712% on all its fees commissions and charges and the owner pays this tax. 23456 - in contrast the contoso lifts invoice explicitly lists tax n/a so no tax is charged to the customer on that invoice. 1114 - the holding tank servicing contract and builders limited warranty do not specify any tax rates or explicit tax passthroughs they focus on service charges and arbitration costs respectively. 81079151617  6.2. selfhelp remedies and arbitrator sanctions vs. fee schedules - the builders limited warranty arbitration program preserves self-help remedies including repossession and setoff and allows parties to seek provisional remedies in court but it does not attach specific fees or taxes to those remedies instead it defines them as rights that can be exercised without waiving arbitration. 151617 - the same arbitration program explicitly allocates arbitration costs 50/50 and allows the arbitrator to impose sanctions for delay but again without a fixed dollar schedule. 151617 - by contrast the property management agreement provides a detailed fee schedule with percentages and fixed dollar amounts and explicitly adds a 4.712% hawaii gross excise tax on those fees all paid by the owner. 23456  6.3. legal fees and enforcement costs - in the builders limited warranty a party who refuses to arbitrate after a lawful demand must bear all costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees incurred by the other party to compel arbitration. 79 - in the purchase contract for the lift if the customer fails to pay legal fees are recoverable by contractor meaning the customer can be required to pay the contractors legal fees in a default scenario. 1213 -

BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION (Fabrikam Inc. \u2194 Contoso Ltd.)\n\n### 1.1. Warranty Remedies (Non\u2011dispute context)\n\n- Fabrikam Inc. (the \u201cBuilder\u201d) warrants that for **one (1) year** certain structural components (floors, ceilings, walls, internal structural components, plumbing including septic tank if installed by Builder, heating, electric wiring systems, and roof) will be free of defects in materials or workmanship by local standards in Pocatello/Chubbuck, Idaho. [1][4]  \n- Fabrikam also warrants that for **sixty (60) days** certain items (doors including hardware, windows, electric switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking around exterior openings, plumbing fixtures, cabinet work) will be free of defects in materials or workmanship. [1][4]  \n- If the Buyer/Owner (Contoso Ltd.) believes a defect is covered, they must **write a letter** describing the defect and send it by **certified mail, return receipt requested** to the Builder at the specified Pocatello address **before the end of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day period**, as applicable. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n- Upon receipt of the Buyer/Owner\u2019s written report of a defect, if the item is covered, the Builder will **repair or replace** it **at no charge** within **sixty (60) days** (longer if delayed by weather, labor, or material shortages). [1][2][3][4][6]  \n- The Builder has **sole discretion** to choose between repair or replacement. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n- Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency (e.g., a burst pipe) **relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages**. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n- Claims not made in writing within the applicable **one (1) year or sixty (60) day** warranty period are **not covered**. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n\nThese provisions function as contractual remedies (repair/replace, and loss of coverage if notice is late) even before any formal \u201cdispute\u201d process. [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n### 1.2. Binding Arbitration as Primary Dispute\u2011Resolution Mechanism\n\n- The agreement contains a dedicated **Arbitration** section (Section 9). [1][2][3][4][6]  \n- It states that, **with the exception of certain preserved remedies (including small claims)**, **\u201call disputes are subject to binding arbitration.\u201d** [1][2][3][4][6]  \n- A **\u201cDispute\u201d** is defined broadly as **\u201cany action, dispute, claim or controversy of any kind, whether founded in contract, tort, statutory or common law, equity, or otherwise, that can not be litigated in the Small Claims Court of the State of Idaho\u201d** and that arises out of or relates to the construction or purchase of the home, the warranty, or related documents. [1][4][6]  \n- Any party may demand arbitration **before the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross\u2011claim, counterclaim, answer, or amendment**. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n- Once a lawful demand is made, **any Dispute must be resolved by binding arbitration** in accordance with the **Arbitration Program** referenced in the contract. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n- Any party who fails to submit to binding arbitration after a lawful demand must **bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees (including those incurred in any trial, bankruptcy proceeding or on appeal)** incurred by the other party in obtaining a stay of judicial proceedings and compelling arbitration. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n- The agreement explicitly states that the parties **understand that disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court**, and that **once decided by arbitration, no dispute can later be brought, filed, or pursued in court except to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s decision**. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n\n**Connection to Hub Entities:**  \n- This is the core **Binding Arbitration** mechanism governing **Disputes** between **Fabrikam Inc.** (Builder) and **Contoso Ltd.** (Buyer/Owner) under the **Arbitration Program**. [1][4][5][6]\n\n### 1.3. Arbitration Administration and Governing Law\n\n- Arbitration is to be **administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d)** or another mutually agreeable administrator. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n- Proceedings follow the **Building Arbitration Rules of the AAA** or other mutually agreed rules. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n- The arbitrator(s) must resolve all Disputes in accordance with the **substantive law of the State of Idaho**. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n- **Judgment upon any award** may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n\nThis ties the **Arbitration Program** to the **AAA** and to Idaho law, as indicated in the entity relationships. [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n### 1.4. Preservation of Certain Court and Self\u2011Help Remedies\n\nSection 9(C) explicitly preserves several non\u2011arbitration remedies: [5]\n\n1. **Small Claims Court:**  \n   - Any party may **pursue a claim within the venue and jurisdiction of the Small Claims Department of the Magistrate Division of the District Courts of the State of Idaho** for **claims for money which do not exceed $3,000**. [5]  \n   - This is a carve\u2011out from arbitration for low\u2011value monetary claims. [5]\n\n2. **Liens and Foreclosure:**  \n   - Parties may **pursue claims of lien or foreclose a lien or mortgage against real or personal property collateral or security**, as necessary to preserve such remedy or enforce an arbitration award or obtain a personal or deficiency award. [5]\n\n3. **Self\u2011Help Remedies:**  \n   - Parties may **exercise self\u2011help remedies**, including **repossession and set\u2011off rights**. [5]\n\n4. **Provisional or Ancillary Judicial Remedies:**  \n   - Parties may seek **injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim & delivery, replevin, garnishment, or appointment of a receiver** from a court having jurisdiction. [5]\n\n- Exercising these rights **does not constitute a waiver** of the right to arbitration, except to the extent such action is contrary to a final arbitration award. [5]  \n- Any claim or Dispute related to the exercise of these self\u2011help or auxiliary rights is itself a **\u201cDispute\u201d** subject to arbitration. [5]\n\n### 1.5. Arbitrator Powers, Costs, and Procedure\n\n- The parties agree to select a **neutral \u201cqualified\u201d arbitrator**; if they cannot agree, selection proceeds under AAA provisions. [5]  \n- The arbitrator(s) may, upon written request of any party:  \n  1. **Consolidate** in a single proceeding any multiple\u2011party claims that are substantially identical or based on the same underlying transaction. [5]  \n  2. **Consolidate** claims and Disputes between other parties (including subcontractors or suppliers) that arise out of or relate to the subject matter. [5]  \n- The first arbitrator selected in any proceeding will conduct the consolidated proceeding unless disqualified for conflict of interest. [5]  \n- The arbitrator(s) may resolve disputes about the **terms of the arbitration clause**, including **questions about arbitrability**, but **may not change or alter the terms of the Arbitration Program**. [5]  \n- Each party must pay **one\u2011half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration** and bear its own costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees, in the arbitration itself. [5]  \n- The arbitrator\u2019s award must be **in writing** and must **set forth the factual and legal basis** for the award. [5]  \n\n### 1.6. Timing, Location, and Confidentiality\n\n- All applicable **statutes of limitation** apply to arbitration proceedings. [5]  \n- The parties agree, to the maximum extent practicable, to take any action necessary to **conclude an arbitration within 180 days of filing a Dispute** with the administrator. [5]  \n- The arbitrator(s) may **impose sanctions** for failure to proceed within the established times. [5]  \n- **Arbitrations shall be conducted in Pocatello, Idaho.** [5]  \n- The Arbitration Program provisions **survive termination, amendment, or expiration** of the warranty or related documents unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. [5]  \n- Each party agrees to keep all **Disputes and arbitration proceedings strictly confidential**, except for disclosures required in the ordinary course of business or by law/regulation. [5]  \n- If any provision of the Arbitration Program is declared invalid, the remaining provisions remain fully enforceable. [5]  \n\n---\n\n## 2. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT (Contoso Ltd. \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThis contract between **Contoso Ltd.** (Holding Tank Owner) and **Fabrikam Inc.** (Pumper) sets out operational obligations but **does not specify any explicit dispute\u2011resolution mechanism or remedies clause**. [7][9]\n\n- The owner must file a copy of the contract with Washburn County as required by **WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5**. [7][9]  \n- The owner must allow access, maintain an all\u2011weather access road, and pay charges as mutually agreed. [7][9]  \n- The pumper must submit detailed service reports to the County (including names, location, permit number, service dates, volumes pumped, disposal sites, and condition of tank/components). [7][9]  \n- The agreement remains in effect until terminated by owner or pumper; changes must be filed with the municipality and County within **ten (10) business days** of any change. [7][9]  \n\nBecause there is **no arbitration clause, no small\u2011claims carve\u2011out, and no explicit litigation or mediation provision**, any dispute\u2011resolution would default to general legal remedies under applicable law, but that is **not stated in the document itself**. [7][9]\n\n---\n\n## 3. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Contoso Ltd. \u2194 Walt Flood Realty / Fabrikam Inc. as signatory)\n\nThis agreement between **Contoso Ltd.** (Owner) and **Walt Flood Realty** (Agent, signed by Fabrikam Inc. as Principal Broker) governs property management for a Hawaii rental property. [8][10]\n\n### 3.1. Remedies / Risk Allocation Clauses\n\n- **Hold Harmless / Indemnity:**  \n  - The Owner agrees that the Agent **\u201cshall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property\u201d** subject to the agreement, **except** for loss or injury caused by the Agent\u2019s **gross negligence or wilful misconduct**. [8][10]  \n  - The Owner must **hold the Agent harmless and indemnify the Agent** for any such claim or liability (i.e., for claims not caused by gross negligence or wilful misconduct). [8][10]  \n  - This functions as a contractual allocation of risk and a remedy in favor of the Agent (indemnification). [8][10]\n\n- **Insurance Requirement:**  \n  - The Owner must provide **Liability Insurance** with minimum limits of **$300,000 for bodily injury** and **$25,000 for property damage to others**, name the Agent as additional insured, and furnish a copy of the policy and certificate of insurance. [8][10]  \n  - This is a preventive risk\u2011management mechanism that supports the indemnity clause. [8][10]\n\n- **Termination:**  \n  - Either party may terminate the agreement upon **sixty (60) days written notice**. [8][10]  \n  - Termination does **not invalidate existing rental agreements** made by the Agent on the Owner\u2019s behalf. [8][10]  \n  - Upon termination, the Owner remains responsible for obligations or expenses incurred by the Agent under the agreement, and if the property is sold, the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations. [8][10]  \n  - These provisions act as remedies for premature termination and protect the Agent and renters. [8][10]\n\n### 3.2. Governing Law / Dispute\u2011Resolution Framework\n\n- The agreement states that it **\u201cshall be governed by the laws of the State of Hawaii.\u201d** [8][10]  \n- It also states that it is the **entire Agreement** and is binding upon successors and assigns of Owner or Agent. [8][10]  \n\nHowever:\n\n- There is **no explicit arbitration clause**, **no mediation requirement**, and **no specific forum selection clause** beyond the governing law statement. [8][10]  \n- Therefore, any disputes would be resolved under **Hawaii law** through ordinary legal processes (e.g., court litigation), but this is **implicit** rather than expressly described as a \u201cdispute\u2011resolution mechanism\u201d in the text. [8][10]\n\n---\n\n## 4. PURCHASE CONTRACT (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThis contract between **Contoso Lifts LLC** (Contractor) and **Fabrikam Inc.** (Customer) governs the purchase and installation of a vertical platform lift. [12][13]\n\n### 4.1. Remedies Related to Payment Default\n\n- Under **\u201cCustomer Default\u201d**, the contract states that **failure to pay may result in legal action**, and **legal fees are recoverable by Contractor**. [12][13]  \n- This is an explicit remedy: the Contractor can sue for non\u2011payment and recover its legal fees. [12][13]\n\n### 4.2. Risk of Loss\n\n- The contract states that the **Contractor holds risk until delivery**, and the **Customer holds risk thereafter**. [12][13]  \n- While not a dispute\u2011resolution mechanism per se, this allocation of risk determines who bears loss if damage occurs at different stages, which affects remedies in case of disputes over damage. [12][13]\n\n### 4.3. Right to Cancel\n\n- The Customer may **cancel within 3 business days** for a **full refund**. [12][13]  \n- After that period, the **deposit is forfeited**. [12][13]  \n- This is a built\u2011in remedial mechanism allowing the Customer to exit the contract early with a defined financial consequence. [12][13]\n\n### 4.4. Warranty\n\n- The contract states that the **manufacturer warranty applies**, and the **Contractor warrants labor for 90 days**. [12][13]  \n- These warranties provide remedial rights (e.g., repair or replacement under manufacturer terms, and labor warranty for 90 days), though the detailed procedures are not spelled out in this document. [12][13]\n\n### 4.5. Applicable Law and Forum Implications\n\n- The contract states that it **\u201cshall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.\u201d** [12][13]  \n- There is **no arbitration clause**, **no mediation requirement**, and **no explicit forum selection clause** beyond governing law. [12][13]  \n- Thus, disputes are implicitly to be resolved under Florida law through ordinary legal processes (e.g., litigation), with the specific remedy of legal\u2011fee recovery for payment default. [12][13]\n\n---\n\n## 5. contoso_lifts_invoice (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2192 Fabrikam Construction)\n\nThe **INVOICE #1256003** from **Contoso Lifts LLC** to **Fabrikam Construction** is a billing document for elevator and lift equipment and services. [11][14]\n\n- It lists items such as a **Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)**, power operation parts, special size cab, outdoor fitting, aluminum door with plexi\u2011glass inserts and automatic door operator, and hall call stations, with a **subtotal of 29,900.00**, **TAX N/A**, **TOTAL 29,900.00**, and **AMOUNT DUE 29,900.00**. [11][14]  \n- It notes that payment is **\u201cDue on contract signing\u201d** and that payments can be made via an online portal. [11][14]  \n\nHowever:\n\n- The invoice **does not contain any explicit dispute\u2011resolution or remedies clause** (no arbitration, no governing law, no default remedies). [11][14]  \n- Any dispute\u2011resolution would be governed by the underlying **purchase contract** between Contoso Lifts LLC and Fabrikam Inc. (which does contain default and legal\u2011action remedies) or by general law, but that linkage is **inferred** rather than stated in the invoice itself. [11][12][13][14]\n\n---\n\n## 6.

[8][10]  \n\n- **Contoso Lifts LLC \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.

[12][13]  \n  - The **Invoice #1256003** reflects the financial terms and items consistent with the lift purchase but does not add any dispute\u2011resolution mechanism.

            "text": "Below is a document-by-document summary of the remedies and dispute\u2011resolution mechanisms described, with all factual statements sourced.\n\n---\n\n## 1. BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION (Fabrikam Inc. \u2194 Contoso Ltd.)\n\n### 1.1. Warranty Remedies (Non\u2011dispute context)\n\n1. **Primary remedy: repair or replacement by the Builder**\n\n   - If the Buyer/Owner (Contoso Ltd.) believes a defect is covered, they must send a written letter describing the defect to Fabrikam Inc. by certified mail, return receipt requested, before the end of the applicable warranty period (one (1) year or sixty (60) days, depending on the item). [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - Upon receipt of the written report, if the item is covered, the Builder (Fabrikam Inc.) will \u201crepair or replace it at no charge to the Buyer/Owner within sixty (60) days (longer if weather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages cause delays).\u201d [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - The work will be done by the Builder or subcontractors chosen by the Builder, and the Builder has \u201csole discretion to choose between repair or replacement.\u201d [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n2. **Emergency remedy / duty to notify**\n\n   - In an emergency (e.g., \u201ca defective pipe has burst\u201d), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately; only emergency reports will be taken by phone. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency \u201crelieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.\u201d [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n3. **Limitation of remedies and exclusions**\n\n   - The warranty excludes \u201cCONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES,\u201d subject to state law limitations. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - Numerous categories of defects and damages are excluded (e.g., ordinary wear and tear, defects covered by manufacturers\u2019 warranties, damage from insects, fire, flood, acts of God, etc.). [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - Any claims not made in writing within the applicable \u201cone (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period\u201d are not covered. [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - All other warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, habitability, and good workmanship, are disclaimed; any implied warranties that a court finds non\u2011disclaimable are limited to the same warranty term. [1][2][3][4][6][11]\n\n4. **Preservation of small\u2011claims and self\u2011help / judicial remedies (see Arbitration section below)**\n\n   - Certain remedies are expressly preserved and may be pursued in court despite the arbitration clause, including small claims actions, lien/foreclosure actions, self\u2011help remedies, and provisional/ancillary judicial remedies such as injunctive relief and attachment. [5]\n\n### 1.2. Arbitration / Dispute\u2011Resolution Mechanism\n\nThe key dispute\u2011resolution mechanism between Fabrikam Inc. (Builder) and Contoso Ltd. (Buyer/Owner) under this warranty is a **Binding Arbitration Program**.\n\n1. **Scope and requirement of binding arbitration**\n\n   - \u201cWith exception of the remedies preserved herein (which includes claims for money within the jurisdiction limits of the small claims court of the State of Idaho) all disputes are subject to binding arbitration.\u201d [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - Any party may demand arbitration \u201cbefore the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross\u2011claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.\u201d [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - A \u201cDispute\u201d is defined broadly as \u201cany action, dispute, claim or controversy of any kind, whether founded in contract, tort, statutory or common law, equity, or otherwise, that can not be litigated in the Small Claims Court of the State of Idaho, now existing or hereafter arising between any of the Parties arising out of, pertaining to or in connection with the construction or purchase of the home or this warranty or any related agreements, documents, or instruments (\u2018Documents\u2019).\u201d [1][2][3][4][6]  \n   - The parties acknowledge that by this agreement \u201cTHEIR DISPUTES SHALL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT, AND ONCE DECIDED BY ARBITRATION NO DISPUTE CAN LATER BE BROUGHT, FILED OR PURSUED IN COURT EXCEPT TO ENFORCE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR.\u201d [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n2. **Consequences for refusing arbitration**\n\n   - Any party who fails to submit to binding arbitration after a lawful demand \u201cshall bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, (including those incurred in any trial, bankruptcy proceeding or on appeal) incurred by the other Party in obtaining a stay of any pending judicial proceeding and compelling arbitration of any Dispute.\u201d [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n3. **Governing rules and law**\n\n   - Arbitration is to be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) or another mutually agreeable administrator, under the AAA\u2019s Building Arbitration Rules or other mutually agreed rules. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n   - The arbitrator(s) must resolve all Disputes \u201cin accordance with the applicable substantive law of the State of Idaho.\u201d [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n   - \u201cJudgment upon any award rendered hereunder may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.\u201d [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n4. **Preserved judicial and self\u2011help remedies (carve\u2011outs from arbitration)**\n\n   The Arbitration Program explicitly preserves several non\u2011arbitration remedies: [5]\n\n   - (1) **Small Claims Court**: Any party may \u201cpursue a claim within the venue and jurisdiction of the Small Claims Department of the Magistrate Division of the District Courts of the State of Idaho as defined at Idaho Code \u00a7 1\u20112301, for claims for money which do not exceed $3,000.\u201d [5]  \n   - (2) **Liens and foreclosure**: Parties may \u201cpursue claims of lien or to foreclose a lien or mortgage against any real or personal property collateral or security, as necessary to preserve such remedy or to enforce any arbitration award, or obtain a personal or deficiency award.\u201d [5]  \n   - (3) **Self\u2011help remedies**: Parties may \u201cexercise self\u2011help remedies (including repossession and set\u2011off rights).\u201d [5]  \n   - (4) **Provisional/ancillary judicial remedies**: Parties may \u201cobtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim & delivery, replevin, garnishment, or the appointment of a receiver from a court having jurisdiction.\u201d [5]  \n   - Exercising these rights \u201cshall not constitute a waiver of the right of any Party to Arbitration,\u201d and any claim or Dispute related to the exercise of these rights is itself a \u201cDispute\u201d subject to arbitration. [5]\n\n5. **Arbitrator powers, consolidation, and costs**\n\n   - The parties agree to select a neutral \u201cqualified\u201d arbitrator; if they cannot agree, they proceed under AAA provisions. [5]  \n   - The arbitrator(s) may, upon written request of any party:  \n     (1) \u201cconsolidate in a single proceeding any multiple party claims that are substantially identical or based upon the same underlying transaction\u201d; and  \n     (2) \u201cconsolidate any claims and Disputes between other Parties which arise out of or relate to the subject matter hereof, including all claims by or against subcontractors or suppliers.\u201d [5]  \n   - In a consolidated proceeding, \u201cthe first arbitrator(s) selected in any proceeding shall conduct the consolidated proceeding unless disqualified due to conflict of interest.\u201d [5]  \n   - The arbitrator(s) may resolve disputes about the terms of the arbitration clause, including \u201cquestions about the arbitrability of any Dispute,\u201d but have \u201cno power to change or alter the terms of this Arbitration Program.\u201d [5]  \n   - Each party must pay one\u2011half (1/2) of the arbitration costs and fees and bear its own costs including attorneys\u2019 fees in arbitration. [5]  \n   - The arbitrator\u2019s award must be in writing and \u201cset forth the factual and legal basis for the award.\u201d [5]\n\n6. **Procedural aspects and timelines**\n\n   - All statutes of limitation applicable to any Dispute apply to arbitration proceedings. [5]  \n   - The parties agree, \u201cto the maximum extent practicable,\u201d to take action necessary to conclude arbitration within \u201c180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator.\u201d [5]  \n   - The arbitrator(s) may impose sanctions for any party\u2019s failure to proceed within the established times. [5]  \n   - Arbitrations are to be conducted in \u201cPocatello, Idaho.\u201d [5]  \n   - The Arbitration Program survives any termination, amendment, or expiration of the warranty or related documents unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. [5]  \n   - Each party agrees to keep all Disputes and arbitration proceedings \u201cstrictly confidential,\u201d subject to ordinary\u2011course business needs or legal requirements. [5]  \n   - If any provision of the Arbitration Program is declared invalid, the remaining provisions remain fully enforceable. [5]\n\n7. **Connection to entities and other documents**\n\n   - The Arbitration Program governs Disputes between Fabrikam Inc. (Builder) and Contoso Ltd. (Buyer/Owner) arising out of the construction or purchase of the home, the warranty, or related agreements/documents. [1][4][5][6]  \n   - The definition of \u201cDispute\u201d explicitly includes claims related to \u201cany related agreements, documents, or instruments (\u2018Documents\u2019),\u201d which can encompass other contracts between these parties concerning the same home or project. [1][4][6]\n\n---\n\n## 2. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT (Contoso Ltd. \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThis contract between Contoso Ltd. (Holding Tank Owner) and Fabrikam Inc. (Pumper) sets out operational obligations but **does not specify any explicit dispute\u2011resolution mechanism or remedies clause** beyond termination and regulatory compliance. [7][9]\n\n1. **Operational obligations (context, not formal dispute mechanism)**\n\n   - The owner must file a copy of the contract with Washburn County as required under WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5. [7][9]  \n   - The owner must allow access, maintain an all\u2011weather access road, and pay charges for servicing as mutually agreed. [7][9]  \n   - The pumper must submit reports to the County including specified data (names, address, location, permit number, service dates, volumes pumped, disposal sites, and condition of the tank and components). [7][9]\n\n2. **Termination as a remedy**\n\n   - The agreement \u201cwill remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract.\u201d [7][9]  \n   - If there is a change in the contract, the owner must file a copy of any changes or a new service contract with the municipality and County within \u201cten (10) business days from the date of change.\u201d [7][9]  \n   - Termination itself functions as the only explicit contractual remedy; there is no arbitration clause, no small\u2011claims carve\u2011out, and no specified forum for disputes in this document. [7][9]\n\n3. **Connection to other entities**\n\n   - This contract involves the same corporate names (Contoso Ltd. and Fabrikam Inc.) as the Builders Limited Warranty, but it is a separate relationship (holding tank servicing in Wisconsin rather than home construction in Idaho). [7][9][1][4]  \n   - Unlike the Builders Limited Warranty, this document does not incorporate any Arbitration Program or reference to AAA or Idaho law. [7][9][1][5]\n\n---\n\n## 3. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Contoso Ltd. \u2194 Walt Flood Realty; Fabrikam Inc. signs as Principal Broker)\n\nThis agreement governs property management for short\u2011term and vacation rentals of a Hawaii property owned by Contoso Ltd. and managed by Walt Flood Realty, where Fabrikam Inc. signs as the Principal Broker for the Agent. [8][10]\n\n1. **Governing law as the only explicit dispute\u2011resolution reference**\n\n   - The agreement states: \u201cGOVERNING LAW. This is the entire Agreement between the parties and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Hawaii. This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.\u201d [8][10]  \n   - No arbitration clause, mediation requirement, or specific forum (e.g., Hawaii courts) is expressly identified beyond the governing law statement. [8][10]\n\n2. **Hold harmless / indemnity as a remedial allocation of risk**\n\n   - The Owner (Contoso Ltd.) agrees that the Agent (Walt Flood Realty) \u201cshall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct.\u201d [8][10]  \n   - The Owner must \u201chold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability\u201d (i.e., claims not caused by the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct). [8][10]  \n   - This functions as a contractual remedy and risk\u2011allocation mechanism, but not a procedural dispute\u2011resolution mechanism like arbitration. [8][10]\n\n3. **Other relevant obligations (context)**\n\n   - The Agent\u2019s responsibilities include inspections, advertising, rent collection, trust account management, monthly statements, and contracting for services, with a requirement for Owner approval for expenditures over \u201cThree Hundred Dollars ($300.00)\u201d except in emergencies. [8][10]  \n   - The Owner must provide liability insurance with minimum limits of \u201c$300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others,\u201d naming the Agent as additional insured and providing a copy and certificate of insurance. [8][10]  \n   - These provisions shape remedies indirectly (e.g., insurance coverage for claims), but the agreement does not specify arbitration, mediation, or a particular court for disputes. [8][10]\n\n4. **Connection to entities**\n\n   - Contoso Ltd. is the Owner; Fabrikam Inc. appears as the signatory \u201cIt\u2019s Principal Broker\u201d for the Agent, Walt Flood Realty. [8][10]  \n   - This is a different relationship and jurisdiction (Hawaii) from the Idaho home warranty and Wisconsin holding tank contract, and it uses governing law and indemnity rather than an arbitration program. [8][10][1][7]\n\n---\n\n## 4. PURCHASE CONTRACT (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThis contract is between Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor) and Fabrikam Inc. (Customer) for the purchase and installation of a vertical platform lift system. [12][13] It does **not** contain an arbitration clause or explicit dispute\u2011resolution forum, but it does include specific remedial provisions.\n\n1. **Customer default and legal action**\n\n   - Under \u201c4. Customer Default,\u201d the contract states: \u201cFailure to pay may result in legal action. Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.\u201d [12][13]  \n   - This creates a remedy for the Contractor (Contoso Lifts LLC) to pursue legal action (presumably in court) and recover legal fees if Fabrikam Inc. fails to pay. [12][13]\n\n2. **Risk of loss allocation**\n\n   - Under \u201c5. Risk of Loss,\u201d the contract provides: \u201cContractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.\u201d [12][13]  \n   - This allocates responsibility for loss or damage as a remedial framework but does not specify a dispute forum. [12][13]\n\n3. **Right to cancel as a customer remedy**\n\n   - Under \u201c11. Right to Cancel,\u201d the contract states: \u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d [12][13]  \n   - This gives the Customer (Fabrikam Inc.) a time\u2011limited remedy (full refund if cancellation occurs within 3 business days) and defines the consequence (forfeiture of deposit) if cancellation occurs later. [12][13]\n\n4. **Applicable law**\n\n   - The contract states: \u201cThis contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.\u201d [12][13]  \n   - No arbitration or mediation is specified; disputes would therefore default to Florida law and, absent other agreement, Florida courts. [12][13]\n\n5. **Connection to invoice and entities**\n\n   - The invoice INVOICE #1256003 from Contoso Lifts LLC to Fabrikam Construction lists a \u201cVertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)\u201d and related components totaling \u201c$29,900.00,\u201d with the comment \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d indicating that the invoice is tied to the purchase contract. [11][14][12][13]  \n   - The purchase contract\u2019s total contract price is \u201c$29,900.00, payable in 3 installments: $20,000.00 upon signing; $7,000.00 upon delivery; $2,900.00 upon completion,\u201d matching the total on the invoice. [12][13][11][14]  \n   - This shows a cross\u2011reference between the contractual remedies (e.g., legal action for non\u2011payment) and the invoicing of the same transaction between Contoso Lifts LLC and Fabrikam Inc./Fabrikam Construction. [11][12][13][14]\n\n---\n\n## 5. contoso_lifts_invoice (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2192 Fabrikam Construction)\n\nThe invoice itself is primarily a billing document and does **not** define dispute\u2011resolution mechanisms, but it references the underlying contract that does. [11][14]\n\n1. **Reference to contract**\n\n   - The invoice includes the comment: \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d linking it to the purchase contract\u2019s payment terms and associated remedies (legal action and fee recovery for non\u2011payment). [11][14][12][13]\n\n2. **Amounts and terms (context)**\n\n   - The invoice total is \u201c$29,900.00,\u201d with \u201cAMOUNT DUE 29900.00,\u201d matching the contract price. [11][14][12][13]  \n   - Terms state \u201cDue on contract signing,\u201d aligning with the first installment of \u201c$20,000.00 upon signing\u201d in the purchase contract, though the invoice itself does not restate the installment structure. [11][14][12][13]  \n   - No arbitration, governing law, or forum selection is specified in the invoice; those are in the purchase contract. [11][14][12][13]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross\u2011Document and Entity\u2011Relationship Perspective\n\n1. **Fabrikam Inc. as a recurring party with different dispute frameworks**\n\n   - In the **Builders Limited Warranty**, Fabrikam Inc. is the Builder and is bound with Contoso Ltd. to a detailed Arbitration Program with binding arbitration, AAA administration, Idaho law, and preserved small\u2011claims and self\u2011help remedies. [1][4][5][6]  \n   - In the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, Fabrikam Inc. is the Pumper, and the contract provides for termination but no arbitration or specified dispute forum. [7][9]  \n   - In the **Purchase Contract** with Contoso Lifts LLC, Fabrikam Inc. is the Customer, subject to Florida law, with remedies including legal action and recovery of legal fees for non\u2011payment, but no arbitration clause. [12][13]  \n   - In the **Property Management Agreement**, Fabrikam Inc. appears as the Principal Broker for the Agent (Walt Flood Realty), under Hawaii law, with indemnity/hold\u2011harmless provisions but no arbitration clause. [8][10]\n\n2. **Contoso entities in different roles**\n\n   - **Contoso Ltd.** is the Buyer/Owner of the home under the Builders Limited Warranty, subject to binding arbitration in Idaho for Disputes with Fabrikam Inc. [1][4][5][6]  \n   - **Contoso Ltd.** is also the Holding Tank Owner in Wisconsin, with only termination and regulatory filing obligations as explicit remedies. [7][9]  \n   - **Contoso Ltd.** is the Owner of the Hawaii rental property, with disputes governed by Hawaii law and subject to indemnity obligations in favor of the Agent. [8][10]  \n   - **Contoso Lifts LLC** is a separate entity (Contractor) contracting with Fabrikam Inc. in Florida, where remedies include legal action, fee recovery, and a 3\u2011business\u2011day cancellation right. [12][13][11][14]\n\n3. **Arbitration vs. court\u2011based remedies**\n\n   - Only the **Builders Limited Warranty** includes a formal Arbitration Program with AAA rules, Idaho law, and detailed procedural provisions. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n   - The **Purchase Contract** and **Property Management Agreement** rely on governing law clauses (Florida and Hawaii respectively) and court\u2011based remedies (legal action, indemnity) without arbitration. [8][10][12][13]  \n   - The **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** is silent on dispute forums, leaving disputes to general law and termination as the primary contractual remedy. [7][9]\n\n---\n\n### Direct Answer to the Query\n\nAcross the provided documents, the remedies and dispute\u2011resolution mechanisms include:\n\n- **Binding arbitration for most Disputes** between Fabrikam Inc. and Contoso Ltd. regarding the Idaho home and warranty, administered by AAA under Idaho law, with small\u2011claims, lien, self\u2011help, and provisional judicial remedies preserved. [1][2][3][4][5][6]  \n- **Repair or replacement at no charge** by Fabrikam Inc. as the primary warranty remedy, subject to written notice, time limits (one (1) year or sixty (60) days), and exclusions.

unlike the builders limited warranty this document does not incorporate any arbitration program or reference to aaa or idaho law. 7915 ---  3. property management agreement contoso ltd.  walt flood realty fabrikam inc. signs as principal broker this agreement governs property management for shortterm and vacation rentals of a hawaii property owned by contoso ltd. and managed by walt flood realty where fabrikam inc. signs as the principal broker for the agent. 810 1. governing law as the only explicit disputeresolution reference -

contoso ltd. is the owner fabrikam inc. appears as the signatory its principal broker for the agent walt flood realty. 810 - this is a different relationship and jurisdiction hawaii from the idaho home warranty and wisconsin holding tank contract and it uses governing law and indemnity rather than an arbitration program. 81017 ---  4. purchase contract contoso lifts llc  fabrikam inc. this contract is between contoso lifts llc contractor and fabrikam inc. customer for the purchase and installation of a vertical platform lift system. 1213 it does not contain an arbitration clause or explicit disputeresolution forum but it does include specific remedial provisions. 1. customer default and legal action -

under 5. risk of loss the contract provides: contractor holds risk until delivery. customer holds risk thereafter. 1213 - this allocates responsibility for loss or damage as a remedial framework but does not specify a dispute forum. 1213 3. right to cancel as a customer remedy - under 11. right to cancel the contract states: customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. afterward deposit is forfeited. 1213 - this gives the customer fabrikam inc. a timelimited remedy full refund if cancellation occurs within 3 business days and defines the consequence forfeiture of deposit if cancellation occurs later. 1213 4. applicable law - the contract states: this contract shall be governed by the laws of the state of florida. 1213 - no arbitration or mediation is specified disputes would therefore default to florida law and absent other agreement florida courts. 1213 5. connection to invoice and entities -

this shows a crossreference between the contractual remedies e.g. legal action for nonpayment and the invoicing of the same transaction between contoso lifts llc and fabrikam inc./fabrikam construction. 11121314 ---  5. contosoliftsinvoice contoso lifts llc  fabrikam construction the invoice itself is primarily a billing document and does not define disputeresolution mechanisms but it references the underlying contract that does. 1114 1. reference to contract - the invoice includes the comment: initial payment in accordance with contract linking it to the purchase contracts payment terms and associated remedies legal action and fee recovery for nonpayment. 11141213 2. amounts and terms context -

no arbitration governing law or forum selection is specified in the invoice those are in the purchase contract. 11141213 ---  6. crossdocument and entityrelationship perspective 1. fabrikam inc. as a recurring party with different dispute frameworks -

in the holding tank servicing contract fabrikam inc. is the pumper and the contract provides for termination but no arbitration or specified dispute forum. 79 - in the purchase contract with contoso lifts llc fabrikam inc. is the customer subject to florida law with remedies including legal action and recovery of legal fees for nonpayment but no arbitration clause. 1213 - in the property management agreement fabrikam inc. appears as the principal broker for the agent walt flood realty under hawaii law with indemnity/holdharmless provisions but no arbitration clause. 810 2. contoso entities in different roles - contoso ltd. is the buyer/owner of the home under the builders limited warranty subject to binding arbitration in idaho for disputes with fabrikam inc. 1456 - contoso ltd. is also the holding tank owner in wisconsin with only termination and regulatory filing obligations as explicit remedies. 79 - contoso ltd. is the owner of the hawaii rental property with disputes governed by hawaii law and subject to indemnity obligations in favor of the agent. 810 - contoso lifts llc is a separate entity contractor contracting with fabrikam inc. in florida where remedies include legal action fee recovery and a 3businessday cancellation right. 12131114 3. arbitration vs. courtbased remedies - only the builders limited warranty includes a formal arbitration program with aaa rules idaho law and detailed procedural provisions. 123456 - the purchase contract and property management agreement rely on governing law clauses florida and hawaii respectively and courtbased remedies legal action indemnity without arbitration. 8101213 - the holding tank servicing contract is silent on dispute forums leaving disputes to general law and termination as the primary contractual remedy. 79 ---  direct answer to the query across the provided documents the remedies and disputeresolution mechanisms include: - binding arbitration for most disputes between fabrikam inc. and contoso ltd. regarding the idaho home and warranty administered by aaa under idaho law with smallclaims lien selfhelp and provisional judicial remedies preserved. 123456 - repair or replacement at no charge by fabrikam inc. as the primary warranty remedy subject to written notice time limits one 1 year or sixty 60 days and exclusions. 12346 - costshifting and fee recovery when a party refuses arbitration other party recovers costs and attorneys fees to compel arbitration and in the purchase contract when the customer fails to pay contractor may take legal action and recover legal fees. 123461213 - termination rights in the holding tank servicing contract either owner or pumper may terminate owner must file changes within ten 10 business days. 79 - indemnity / holdharmless in the property management agreement owner indemnifies agent except for agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct. 810 - right to cancel in the purchase contract customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund after that deposit is forfeited. 1213 - riskofloss allocation contractor holds risk until delivery customer thereafter and governing law clauses idaho for the warranty arbitration hawaii for property management florida for the lift purchase. 1234568101213"

BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION (Fabrikam Inc. \u2194 Contoso Ltd.)\n\n### 1.1. Warranty Remedies (Repair/Replacement and Claim Procedure)\n\n- Fabrikam Inc. (the Builder) provides a limited warranty to Contoso Ltd. (the Buyer/Owner) covering specified components of the home for defined periods. Floors, ceilings, walls, internal structural components, plumbing (including septic tank if installed by Builder), heating, electric wiring systems, and the roof are warranted to be free of defects in materials or workmanship for one (1) year by local construction standards. Doors (including hardware), windows, electric switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking around exterior openings, plumbing fixtures, and cabinet work are warranted for sixty (60) days. [1][4]\n\n- To invoke warranty remedies, the Buyer/Owner must notify the Builder in writing before the end of the applicable one (1) year or sixty (60) day period, describing the defect and sending the letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Builder\u2019s office (Fabrikam Inc., 1820 Summit Ridge Dr., Pocatello, ID 83201). [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n- Claims not made in writing within the applicable one (1) year or sixty (60) day period are not covered, \u201cREGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY.\u201d [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n- Upon receipt of the written report of a defect, if the item is covered, the Builder will repair or replace it at no charge to the Buyer/Owner within sixty (60) days, or longer if delayed by weather, labor, or material shortages. The Builder has sole discretion to choose between repair or replacement and may use its own subcontractors. [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n- In an emergency (e.g., a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately; only emergency reports are taken by phone. Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages. [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n- The warranty is not transferable; it terminates if the first purchaser sells or moves out of the home. [1][2][3][4][6]\n\nThese provisions create a primary remedy of repair or replacement, conditioned on timely written notice and, for emergencies, prompt phone notice. [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n### 1.2. Binding Arbitration as the Primary Dispute\u2011Resolution Mechanism\n\n- The agreement contains a Binding Arbitration clause (the \u201cArbitration Program\u201d) that applies to \u201call disputes\u201d except certain preserved remedies. [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n- A \u201cDispute\u201d is defined broadly as \u201cany action, dispute, claim or controversy of any kind, whether founded in contract, tort, statutory or common law, equity, or otherwise, that can not be litigated in the Small Claims Court of the State of Idaho, now existing or hereafter arising between any of the Parties arising out of, pertaining to or in connection with the construction or purchase of the home or this warranty or any related agreements, documents, or instruments (\u2018Documents\u2019).\u201d [1][3][4][6]\n\n- Any Dispute must be resolved by binding arbitration upon demand of a party, if the demand is made before any judicial proceeding is instituted or within not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross\u2011claim, counterclaim, answer, or any amendment to those pleadings. [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n- The parties expressly acknowledge that by this agreement they have decided that their disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court, and once decided by arbitration no Dispute can later be brought, filed, or pursued in court except to enforce the arbitrator\u2019s decision. [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n- Arbitration is to be administered by the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) or another mutually agreeable administrator, under the AAA\u2019s Building Arbitration Rules or other mutually agreed rules. [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n- The arbitrator(s) must apply the substantive law of the State of Idaho, and judgment on any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n- Any party who fails to submit to binding arbitration after a lawful demand must bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees (including those incurred in any trial, bankruptcy proceeding, or on appeal), incurred by the other party in obtaining a stay of any pending judicial proceeding and compelling arbitration. This functions as a cost\u2011shifting remedy to enforce the arbitration obligation. [1][2][3][4][6]\n\n- All statutes of limitation applicable to any Dispute apply to arbitration proceedings. The parties agree to take action to conclude arbitration within 180 days of filing a Dispute with the Administrator, and the arbitrator(s) may impose sanctions for failure to proceed within the established times. [5]\n\n- Arbitrations are to be conducted in Pocatello, Idaho. [5]\n\n- The arbitrator(s) are empowered to resolve disputes about the terms of the arbitration clause, including arbitrability, but have no power to change or alter the terms of the Arbitration Program. [5]\n\n- The arbitrator(s) may consolidate multiple party claims that are substantially identical or based on the same transaction, and may consolidate claims and Disputes involving other parties such as subcontractors or suppliers. [5]\n\n- Each party must pay one\u2011half (1/2) of the arbitration costs and fees, and each bears its own costs including attorneys\u2019 fees in the arbitration itself (separate from the cost\u2011shifting for refusing arbitration noted above). [5]\n\n- The arbitrator\u2019s award must be in writing and set forth the factual and legal basis for the award. [5]\n\n- The arbitration provisions survive termination, amendment, or expiration of the warranty or related documents unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. [5]\n\n- Each party agrees to keep all Disputes and arbitration proceedings strictly confidential, subject to disclosures required in the ordinary course of business or by law. [5]\n\nThese provisions collectively establish binding arbitration as the central dispute\u2011resolution mechanism between Fabrikam Inc. and Contoso Ltd. for home construction/warranty disputes, with detailed procedural rules and cost allocations. [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n### 1.3. Preserved Non\u2011Arbitration Remedies (Small Claims, Liens, Self\u2011Help, Court Relief)\n\nThe Arbitration Program explicitly preserves certain remedies that may be pursued outside arbitration:\n\n- Small Claims: Any party may pursue a claim within the venue and jurisdiction of the Small Claims Department of the Magistrate Division of the District Courts of the State of Idaho (Idaho Code \u00a7 1\u20112301) for claims for money not exceeding $3,000. [5]\n\n- Liens and Foreclosure: Parties may pursue claims of lien or foreclose a lien or mortgage against real or personal property collateral or security, as necessary to preserve such remedy or to enforce any arbitration award or obtain a personal or deficiency award. [5]\n\n- Self\u2011Help Remedies: Parties may exercise self\u2011help remedies, including repossession and set\u2011off rights. [5]\n\n- Provisional/Ancillary Court Remedies: Parties may obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court having jurisdiction, such as injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim & delivery, replevin, garnishment, or appointment of a receiver. [5]\n\n- Exercising these rights does not constitute a waiver of the right to arbitration, except to the extent such action is contrary to a final arbitration award. Any claim or Dispute related to the exercise of these self\u2011help or auxiliary rights is itself a \u201cDispute\u201d subject to arbitration. [5]\n\nThus, while binding arbitration is mandatory for most Disputes, the agreement carves out specific court and self\u2011help remedies, especially for small monetary claims and security enforcement. [1][2][3][4][5][6]\n\n---\n\n## 2. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT (Contoso Ltd. \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThis contract between Contoso Ltd. (holding tank owner) and Fabrikam Inc. (pumper) sets out operational obligations but does not expressly define a formal dispute\u2011resolution mechanism such as arbitration or mediation. [7][9]\n\n### 2.1. Operational Obligations (Implied Remedies via Performance/Termination)\n\n- The owner (Contoso Ltd.) agrees to:\n  - File a copy of the contract with Washburn County as required under WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5. [7][9]\n  - Permit the pumper (Fabrikam Inc.) access to the property to service the holding tank(s).

[7][9]\n\n- The agreement remains in effect until the owner or pumper terminates it. In the event of a change, the owner must file a copy of any changes or a new service contract with the municipality and County within ten (10) business days from the date of change. [7][9]\n\nWhile no explicit arbitration or court forum is specified, termination of the contract is an express remedy available to either party, and non\u2011performance (e.g., failure to pay or to service) would be addressed under general contract law, presumably through litigation or negotiated resolution. [7][9]\n\n---\n\n## 3. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Contoso Ltd. \u2194 Walt Flood Realty; Fabrikam Inc. as signatory)\n\nThis agreement appoints Walt Flood Realty as Agent to manage Contoso Ltd.\u2019s property \u201cPacific View Retreat\u201d in Honolulu, HI. Fabrikam Inc. signs as the Principal Broker for the Agent. [8][10]\n\n### 3.1. Indemnity / Hold Harmless (Risk\u2011Allocation Remedy)\n\n- The Owner (Contoso Ltd.) agrees that the Agent (Walt Flood Realty) \u201cshall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct.\u201d [8][10]\n\n- The Owner further agrees to hold the Agent harmless and indemnify the Agent for any such claim or liability (i.e., claims not caused by the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct). [8][10]\n\nThis hold\u2011harmless and indemnity clause is a remedial mechanism allocating responsibility for third\u2011party claims: the Owner must indemnify the Agent except where the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct is involved. [8][10]\n\n### 3.2. Governing Law (Forum Guidance, but No Specific ADR Clause)\n\n- The agreement states it \u201cshall be governed by the laws of the State of Hawaii\u201d and is the entire agreement between the parties, binding on successors and assigns. [8][10]\n\n- There is no explicit arbitration, mediation, or forum\u2011selection clause; disputes would therefore be resolved under Hawaii law in the appropriate courts unless the parties agree otherwise. [8][10]\n\n### 3.3. Other Contractual Mechanisms with Remedial Effect\n\nWhile not labeled as \u201cdispute\u2011resolution,\u201d several provisions function as remedies or risk\u2011allocation tools:\n\n- Agent\u2019s Fees: The Owner must pay specified fees and commissions, including:\n  - 25% of gross revenues for short\u2011term/vacation rentals (less than 180 days). [8][10]\n  - 10% of gross revenues for long\u2011term leases (more than 180 days). [8][10]\n  - $75.00/month advertising pro\u2011ration charge for short\u2011term rentals. [8][10]\n  - $50.00/month minimum administration and accounting charge. [8][10]\n  - 10% fee on total charge for repairs, upgrades, renovations. [8][10]\n  - $35/hour for scheduling repairs, upgrades, replacements, and escorting contractors. [8][10]\n  - Hawaii Gross Excise tax at 4.712% on all fees, commissions, and charges. [8][10]\n\n- Agency Start\u2011Up Fee: Upon execution, the Owner pays a non\u2011refundable $250.00 start\u2011up fee to cover initial administrative expenses, inventory, inspection report, and other initial sums. [8][10]\n\n- Termination: Either party may terminate the agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice, but termination does not invalidate existing rental agreements; the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations and remain responsible for obligations or expenses incurred by the Agent. [8][10]\n\nThese mechanisms define financial consequences and ongoing obligations, which in practice shape how disputes over performance and fees would be resolved (e.g., claims for unpaid commissions or improper charges). [8][10]\n\n---\n\n## 4. PURCHASE CONTRACT (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2194 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThis contract governs the purchase and installation of a vertical platform lift by Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor) for Fabrikam Inc. (Customer). [12][13]\n\n### 4.1. Legal Action and Recovery of Legal Fees (Dispute\u2011Resolution via Litigation)\n\n- Under \u201cCustomer Default,\u201d the contract states that failure to pay may result in legal action, and legal fees are recoverable by the Contractor. [12][13]\n\n- This explicitly contemplates court litigation as the enforcement mechanism for payment disputes, with fee\u2011shifting in favor of the Contractor if it must sue to collect. [12][13]\n\n### 4.2. Governing Law and Risk Allocation\n\n- The contract is governed by the laws of the State of Florida. [12][13]\n\n- Risk of loss is allocated such that the Contractor holds risk until delivery, and the Customer holds risk thereafter. [12][13]\n\nThese provisions guide how disputes will be resolved (in courts applying Florida law) and who bears loss at different stages, which is central to remedies in case of damage or loss. [12][13]\n\n### 4.3. Right to Cancel (Customer Remedy)\n\n- The Customer may cancel within 3 business days for a full refund. Afterward, the deposit is forfeited. [12][13]\n\nThis is a specific remedial mechanism giving the Customer a short\u2011term rescission right with a full refund, and defining the consequence (forfeiture of deposit) if cancellation occurs later. [12][13]\n\n### 4.4. Changes and Payment Milestones (Operational Remedies)\n\n- Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone. [12][13]\n\n- Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in three installments:\n  - $20,000.00 upon signing\n  - $7,000.00 upon delivery\n  - $2,900.00 upon completion. [12][13]\n\nThese terms structure performance and payment; disputes over scope or timing would be resolved by reference to these milestones and written change orders, again under Florida law in court. [12][13]\n\n---\n\n## 5. INVOICE #1256003 (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2192 Fabrikam Construction)\n\nThe invoice from Contoso Lifts LLC to Fabrikam Construction (INVOICE #1256003) lists equipment, prices, and payment terms but does not contain an explicit dispute\u2011resolution clause. [11][14]\n\n- The invoice total is $29,900.00, with line items such as:\n  - 1 Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504) at $11,200.00\n  - 1 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts at $3,000.00\n  - 1 Special Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3 at $5,800.00\n  - 1 Outdoor fitting at $2,000.00\n  - 1 80\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi\u2011glass inserts, WR\u2011500 lock, automatic door operator at $5,000.00\n  - 2 Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing at $1,450.00 each, total $2,900.00\n  - Subtotal $29,900.00, Tax N/A, Total $29,900.00, Amount Due $29,900.00. [11][14]\n\n- Terms state \u201cDue on contract signing,\u201d and the comments note \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d indicating that any dispute would likely be governed by the underlying purchase contract\u2019s remedies (legal action and fee recovery) rather than by the invoice itself. [11][12][13][14]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross\u2011Document and Entity Relationships\n\n- Fabrikam Inc. appears as:\n  - The Builder in the Builders Limited Warranty with Arbitration with Contoso Ltd. as Buyer/Owner, where binding arbitration is the primary dispute\u2011resolution mechanism with preserved small\u2011claims and security\u2011enforcement remedies.

[7][9]\n  - The Customer in the Purchase Contract with Contoso Lifts LLC as Contractor, where disputes (especially non\u2011payment) are resolved via legal action in Florida courts with recoverable legal fees.

            "text_norm": "below is a document-by-document summary of the remedies and disputeresolution mechanisms described with all factual statements sourced. ---  1. builders limited warranty with arbitration fabrikam inc.  contoso ltd.  1.1. warranty remedies repair/replacement and claim procedure -

to invoke warranty remedies the buyer/owner must notify the builder in writing before the end of the applicable one 1 year or sixty 60 day period describing the defect and sending the letter by certified mail return receipt requested to the builders office fabrikam inc. 1820 summit ridge dr. pocatello id 83201. 12346 - claims not made in writing within the applicable one 1 year or sixty 60 day period are not covered regardless of discoverability. 12346 - upon receipt of the written report of a defect if the item is covered the builder will repair or replace it at no charge to the buyer/owner within sixty 60 days or longer if delayed by weather labor or material shortages. the builder has sole discretion to choose between repair or replacement and may use its own subcontractors. 12346 - in an emergency e.g. a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately only emergency reports are taken by phone. failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages. 12346 - the warranty is not transferable it terminates if the first purchaser sells or moves out of the home. 12346 these provisions create a primary remedy of repair or replacement conditioned on timely written notice and for emergencies prompt phone notice. 12346  1.2. binding arbitration as the primary disputeresolution mechanism - the agreement contains a binding arbitration clause the arbitration program that applies to all disputes except certain preserved remedies. 12346 - a dispute is defined broadly as any action dispute claim or controversy of any kind whether founded in contract tort statutory or common law equity or otherwise that can not be litigated in the small claims court of the state of idaho now existing or hereafter arising between any of the parties arising out of pertaining to or in connection with the construction or purchase of the home or this warranty or any related agreements documents or instruments documents. 1346 - any dispute must be resolved by binding arbitration upon demand of a party if the demand is made before any judicial proceeding is instituted or within not more than 60 days after service of a complaint third party complaint crossclaim counterclaim answer or any amendment to those pleadings. 12346 - the parties expressly acknowledge that by this agreement they have decided that their disputes shall be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court and once decided by arbitration no dispute can later be brought filed or pursued in court except to enforce the arbitrators decision. 123456 - arbitration is to be administered by the american arbitration association aaa or another mutually agreeable administrator under the aaas building arbitration rules or other mutually agreed rules. 123456 - the arbitrators must apply the substantive law of the state of idaho and judgment on any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. 123456 - any party who fails to submit to binding arbitration after a lawful demand must bear all costs and expenses including reasonable attorneys fees including those incurred in any trial bankruptcy proceeding or on appeal incurred by the other party in obtaining a stay of any pending judicial proceeding and compelling arbitration. this functions as a costshifting remedy to enforce the arbitration obligation. 12346 - all statutes of limitation applicable to any dispute apply to arbitration proceedings. the parties agree to take action to conclude arbitration within 180 days of filing a dispute with the administrator and the arbitrators may impose sanctions for failure to proceed within the established times. 5 - arbitrations are to be conducted in pocatello idaho. 5 - the arbitrators are empowered to resolve disputes about the terms of the arbitration clause including arbitrability but have no power to change or alter the terms of the arbitration program. 5 - the arbitrators may consolidate multiple party claims that are substantially identical or based on the same transaction and may consolidate claims and disputes involving other parties such as subcontractors or suppliers. 5 - each party must pay onehalf 1/2 of the arbitration costs and fees and each bears its own costs including attorneys fees in the arbitration itself separate from the costshifting for refusing arbitration noted above. 5 - the arbitrators award must be in writing and set forth the factual and legal basis for the award. 5 - the arbitration provisions survive termination amendment or expiration of the warranty or related documents unless the parties expressly agree otherwise in writing. 5 - each party agrees to keep all disputes and arbitration proceedings strictly confidential subject to disclosures required in the ordinary course of business or by law. 5 these provisions collectively establish binding arbitration as the central disputeresolution mechanism between fabrikam inc. and contoso ltd. for home construction/warranty disputes with detailed procedural rules and cost allocations. 123456  1.3. preserved nonarbitration remedies small claims liens selfhelp court relief the arbitration program explicitly preserves certain remedies that may be pursued outside arbitration: - small claims: any party may pursue a claim within the venue and jurisdiction of the small claims department of the magistrate division of the district courts of the state of idaho idaho code  12301 for claims for money not exceeding $3000. 5 - liens and foreclosure: parties may pursue claims of lien or foreclose a lien or mortgage against real or personal property collateral or security as necessary to preserve such remedy or to enforce any arbitration award or obtain a personal or deficiency award. 5 - selfhelp remedies: parties may exercise selfhelp remedies including repossession and setoff rights. 5 - provisional/ancillary court remedies: parties may obtain provisional or ancillary remedies from a court having jurisdiction such as injunctive relief sequestration attachment claim  delivery replevin garnishment or appointment of a receiver. 5 - exercising these rights does not constitute a waiver of the right to arbitration except to the extent such action is contrary to a final arbitration award. any claim or dispute related to the exercise of these selfhelp or auxiliary rights is itself a dispute subject to arbitration. 5 thus while binding arbitration is mandatory for most disputes the agreement carves out specific court and selfhelp remedies especially for small monetary claims and security enforcement. 123456 ---  2. holding tank servicing contract contoso ltd.  fabrikam inc. this contract between contoso ltd. holding tank owner and fabrikam inc. pumper sets out operational obligations but does not expressly define a formal disputeresolution mechanism such as arbitration or mediation. 79  2.1. operational obligations implied remedies via performance/termination -

All factual statements are sourced.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Property Management Agreement (Contoso Ltd. \u2013 Walt Flood Realty)\n\n### a. Termination notice\n\n- Either party may terminate the agreement **\u201cupon sixty (60) days written notice\u201d**. This is an explicit requirement that termination must be in **written** form and given at least **60 days** before termination. [1][7][12]\n\n### b. Owner\u2019s written notifications to Agent\n\n- The Owner (Contoso Ltd.) must **\u201cProvide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.\u201d** This is an explicit written notice obligation with a **5 business day** deadline. [1][7][12]  \n- The Owner must also **\u201cnotify Agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.\u201d** This is an explicit notification requirement, though the method (written vs. oral) is not specified here. [1][7][12]\n\n### c. Delivery / receipt acknowledgment of the Agreement\n\n- The Agreement states: **\u201cSIGNED in duplicate \u2026 Both parties acknowledge receipt of a copy of this Agreement.\u201d** This reflects that each party receives a delivered copy of the fully executed agreement, though the mode of delivery is not specified. [1][7][12]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Builders Limited Warranty with Arbitration (Fabrikam Inc. \u2013 Contoso Ltd.)\n\nThis document contains the most detailed **notice and delivery** mechanisms.\n\n### a. Written notice of warranty claims (defects)\n\n- The warranty states that **\u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d** This explicitly requires that warranty claims be **made in writing** within the applicable **1 year** or **60 day** period. [5][10]\n\n- Under **\u201cNotification of Defects\u201d**, it specifies that if the Buyer/Owner believes a defect is covered, the Buyer/Owner must **\u201cwrite a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder's office address below.\u201d** This is an explicit **written notice** requirement, with a specified **delivery method**:  \n  - **Certified mail, return receipt requested**. [5][10]  \n  - Addressed to Fabrikam Inc. at:  \n    - Representative: John Smith  \n    - Company: Fabrikam Inc.  \n    - Street: **1820 Summit Ridge Dr.**  \n    - City, State, Zip: **Pocatello, ID 83201**. [5][10]\n\n- The same section reiterates that **\u201cAny and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable\u201d** are excluded, reinforcing the written notice requirement and the time limits. [5][10]\n\n### b. Required content of written notice\n\n- The Buyer/Owner **\u201cmust tell the Builder in writing what times during the day that the Buyer/Owner will be at home, so that the Builder can schedule service calls appropriately.\u201d** This is an explicit requirement that the written notice include availability windows. [5][10]\n\n### c. Emergency notice by telephone\n\n- For emergencies, the warranty provides a separate **phone-based notice mechanism**:  \n  - \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must **telephone the Builder immediately. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.**\u201d [5][10]  \n  - It further states that **\u201cFailure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.\u201d** This creates a duty to give **immediate telephone notice** for emergencies. [5][10]\n\n### d. Arbitration and court filings / remedies (procedural \u201cdelivery\u201d of disputes)\n\nWhile not \u201cnotice\u201d in the sense of letters, the arbitration clause describes how disputes are initiated and what court filings/remedies are preserved:\n\n- **Arbitration demand timing**: A party may demand arbitration **\u201cbefore the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.\u201d** This describes timing relative to **service of court pleadings**, i.e., formal legal delivery/filing of claims. [5][10]\n\n- **Preservation of remedies / court filings**: The clause preserves the right to:  \n  1. **\u201cpursue a claim within the venue and jurisdiction of the Small Claims Department of the Magistrate Division of the District Courts of the State of Idaho \u2026 for claims for money which do not exceed $3,000\u201d** \u2013 implying filing of a small-claims action. [13][14][15][16]  \n  2. **\u201cpursue claims of lien or to foreclose a lien or mortgage against any real or personal property collateral or security, as necessary to preserve such remedy or to enforce any arbitration award, or obtain a personal or deficiency award\u201d** \u2013 i.e., filing lien and foreclosure actions. [13][14][15][16]  \n  3. **\u201cexercise self-help remedies (including repossession and set-off rights)\u201d** \u2013 no formal notice mechanism specified, but these are non-judicial enforcement actions. [13][14][15][16]  \n  4. **\u201cobtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim & delivery, replevin, garnishment, or the appointment of a receiver from a court having jurisdiction.\u201d** These are all court-based remedies that require formal filings and service, though the document does not detail the service mechanics. [13][14][15][16]\n\nThese provisions collectively describe **how disputes and remedies are \u201cdelivered\u201d into arbitration or court**, but they do not specify a particular notice format (e.g., certified mail) beyond referencing service of complaints and other pleadings. [5][10][13][14][15][16]\n\n### e. Entire Agreement clause (modifications must be in writing)\n\n- The **Entire Agreement** section states that **\u201cNo modifications to the Agreement shall be effective or binding unless in writing over the duly authorized signatures of the parties hereto.\u201d** This is an explicit requirement that any change be **delivered in written form and signed** by authorized representatives. [13][14][15][16]\n\n---\n\n## 3. Purchase Contract (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2013 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThe purchase contract itself does not specify a formal notice mechanism (e.g., certified mail) for changes or cancellation, but it does impose **written** requirements and defines **delivery** in the performance sense.\n\n### a. Written changes\n\n- Under **\u201c3. Changes\u201d**, the contract states: **\u201cAny changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone.\u201d** This is an explicit requirement that modifications be **in writing**, though it does not specify how that writing is delivered (mail, email, etc.). [3][4][9]\n\n### b. Delivery of goods (performance delivery, not notice)\n\n- The **Delivery** section states: **\u201cDelivery expected 8-10 weeks after drawing approval. Delay causes include factory and permits.\u201d** This is a timeline for **physical delivery** of the lift, not a notice mechanism, but it is an explicit delivery term. [3][4][9]\n\n- The **Payment Terms** tie payment to delivery:  \n  - Total price **$29,900.00**, payable in 3 installments:  \n    - **$20,000.00 upon signing**  \n    - **$7,000.00 upon delivery**  \n    - **$2,900.00 upon completion**. [3][4][9]  \n  This uses \u201cdelivery\u201d as a milestone but does not specify how the fact of delivery is to be noticed or documented.\n\n### c. Right to cancel (timing, but no specified notice method)\n\n- The **Right to Cancel** clause states: **\u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d** This sets a **3 business day** deadline for cancellation but does not specify whether cancellation must be in writing, by phone, or otherwise. [3][4][9]\n\n### d. Assignment \u2013 written consent\n\n- The **Assignment** clause states: **\u201cNeither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.\u201d** This requires **written consent**, but again does not specify the delivery mechanism. [3][4][9]\n\n---\n\n## 4. Contoso Lifts LLC Invoice\n\nThe invoice primarily provides contact and payment channels rather than formal legal notice mechanisms, but it does specify communication methods and a payment portal.\n\n### a. Mailing address and phone/fax contact\n\n- The invoice lists Contoso Lifts LLC\u2019s mailing address:  \n  - **\u201cP.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL. 33304-0708\u201d**. [2][8]  \n- It also provides phone and fax numbers:  \n  - **Phone: (561) 353-5111 Fax: (561) 211-7333**. [2][8]  \n- For questions, it states: **\u201cIf you have any questions concerning this invoice, contact Jim Contoso, (305) 490-5997, jim@contosolifts.com.\u201d** This explicitly provides **telephone** and **email** as communication channels for inquiries, though not framed as formal legal notice. [2][8]\n\n### b. Payment delivery mechanisms\n\n- The invoice instructs: **\u201cMake all checks payable to Contoso Lifts LLC.\u201d** This implies payment by mailed check to the P.O. Box, though the exact mailing instruction is not spelled out beyond the address. [2][8]  \n- It also states: **\u201cPayments can also be made via our online portal: https://ww.contosolifts.com/portal/pay\u201d**, which is an explicit **online delivery mechanism** for payments. [2][8]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Holding Tank Servicing Contract (Contoso Ltd. \u2013 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThis contract includes explicit **filing** and **reporting** obligations, which are forms of delivery to government entities.\n\n### a. Owner\u2019s filing obligations with County / municipality\n\n- **Section 1**: \u201cThe owner agrees to **file a copy of this contract with the County of Washburn**, as required under WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5.\u201d This is an explicit requirement to **file** (deliver) a copy of the contract to the County. [6][11]\n\n- **Section 4**: \u201cIn the event of a change in this contract, the owner agrees to **file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the County named above within ten (10) business days from the date of change** to this service contract.\u201d This is an explicit filing/delivery mechanism with:  \n  - A **10 business day** deadline.  \n  - Recipients: the **municipality** and the **County of Washburn**. [6][11]\n\n### b. Pumper\u2019s reporting obligations to County\n\n- **Section 3**: \u201cThe pumper agrees to **submit to the County, reports for the servicing of the holding tank(s) in manner specified by the County.**\u201d This is an explicit obligation to **submit reports** (a form of delivery) to the County. [6][11]\n\n- The same section lists required contents of each report, which must include:  \n  a. \u201cThe name and address of the person responsible for servicing the holding tank;\u201d [6][11]  \n  b. \u201cThe name of the owner of the holding tank;\u201d [6][11]  \n  c. \u201cThe location of the property on which the holding tank is installed;\u201d [6][11]  \n  d. \u201cThe sanitary permit number issued for the holding tank;\u201d [6][11]  \n  e. \u201cThe dates on which the holding tank was serviced;\u201d [6][11]  \n  f. \u201cThe volumes in gallons of the contents pumped from the holding tank for each servicing;\u201d [6][11]  \n  g. \u201cThe disposal sites to which the contents from the holding tank were delivered.\u201d [6][11]  \n  h. \u201cCondition of holding tank and components at time of inspection.\u201d [6][11]  \n\n  These items define the **content** of the reports that must be delivered to the County, though the exact transmission method (\u201cmanner specified by the County\u201d) is left to County rules. [6][11]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross-Document Connections via Entities\n\n### a. Contoso Ltd. and Fabrikam Inc. across multiple agreements\n\n- **Contoso Ltd.** appears as:  \n  - Owner in the **Property Management Agreement** with Walt Flood Realty, where it must give **60 days written notice** to terminate and **written notification within five (5) business days** of a listing agreement. [1][7][12]  \n  - Buyer/Owner in the **Builders Limited Warranty**, where it must send **certified mail, return receipt requested** letters to Fabrikam Inc. to report defects and must telephone for emergencies. [5][10]  \n  - Holding Tank Owner in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, where it must **file copies** of the contract and any changes with the County and municipality within **ten (10) business days**. [6][11]\n\n- **Fabrikam Inc.** appears as:  \n  - Builder in the **Builders Limited Warranty**, receiving certified-mail notices of defects and emergency phone calls. [5][10]  \n  - Customer in the **Purchase Contract** with Contoso Lifts LLC, where changes must be **agreed to in writing** and cancellation must occur within **3 business days** (method not specified). [3][4][9]  \n  - Pumper in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, obligated to **submit reports** to the County with specified content. [6][11]\n\nThis shows a consistent pattern: when Contoso Ltd. and Fabrikam Inc. contract with each other or third parties, **formal written mechanisms** (written notice, certified mail, written modifications, filed copies, written reports) are repeatedly required, and **time-bound deadlines** (60 days, 5 business days, 3 business days, 10 business days, 1 year, 60 days) are explicitly specified. [1][3][4][5][6][7][9][10][11][12]\n\n### b. Entire Agreement and written modifications vs. notice\n\n- The **Entire Agreement** clause in the Builders Limited Warranty requires that **\u201cNo modifications to the Agreement shall be effective or binding unless in writing over the duly authorized signatures of the parties hereto.\u201d** [13][14][15][16]  \n- The **Purchase Contract** similarly requires that **\u201cAny changes must be agreed to in writing\u201d** and that **assignment** requires **\u201cwritten consent.\u201d** [3][4][9]  \n- These clauses govern **how changes are validly delivered and accepted** (written, signed), complementing the more specific **notice** mechanisms (certified mail, written notifications, filings) elsewhere. [3][4][9][13][14][15][16]\n\n---\n\n## 7. Consolidated List of Explicit Notice / Delivery Mechanisms\n\n1. **60 days written notice** to terminate Property Management Agreement (either party). [1][7][12]  \n2. **Written notification within five (5) business days** by Owner to Agent upon entering a listing agreement for sale. [1][7][12]  \n3.

Written defect notice must state **times during the day** when Buyer/Owner will be at home. [5][10]  \n6. **Emergency reports** under the warranty must be given by **telephone immediately**; **only emergency reports will be taken by phone**, and failure to promptly notify relieves the Builder of liability. [5][10]  \n7. Arbitration demand timing tied to **service of complaints and other pleadings** (up to **60 days** after service). [5][10]  \n8. Preservation of court remedies: ability to **file** small-claims actions (\u2264 **$3,000**), liens, foreclosures, and to seek **provisional or ancillary remedies** (injunction, sequestration, attachment, **claim & delivery**, replevin, garnishment, receiver) in court. [13][14][15][16]  \n9. **Modifications** to the Builders Limited Warranty must be **in writing** and signed by duly authorized parties. [13][14][15][16]  \n10. **Changes** to the Purchase Contract must be **agreed to in writing**. [3][4][9]  \n11. **Assignment** of the Purchase Contract requires the other party\u2019s **written consent**. [3][4][9]  \n12.

[2][8]\n\nThese are all the explicit notice, delivery, filing, and reporting mechanisms described in the retrieved documents, with their associated deadlines, formats, and destinations.",

Property Management Agreement (Contoso Ltd. \u2013 Walt Flood Realty)\n\n### a. Termination notice\n\n- Either party may terminate the agreement \u201cupon sixty (60) days written notice.\u201d [1][7][12]  \n  - This is an explicit requirement that termination must be in **written** form and given **60 days** in advance. [1][7][12]\n\n### b. Owner\u2019s notice obligations to Agent\n\n- The Owner must \u201cprovide Agent with **written notification within five (5) business days** of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.\u201d [1][7][12]  \n  - This is a written notice requirement tied to a **5 business day** deadline after entering a listing agreement. [1][7][12]\n- The Owner must also \u201cnotify Agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.\u201d [1][7][12]  \n  - This is an explicit obligation to **notify** (form not specified) the Agent before granting access to third parties. [1][7][12]\n\n### c. Entire Agreement / modification mechanism\n\n- The agreement states: \u201cThis is the entire Agreement between the parties and shall be governed by the laws of the State of Hawaii.\u201d [1][7][12]  \n  - While this is an entire-agreement clause, it does **not** itself specify a notice method, but it frames that any obligations (including notice obligations) must be found in this written document. [1][7][12]\n\n**Connection to hub entities:**  \n- The \u201csixty (60) days written notice\u201d termination right is the explicit notice mechanism tied to the **Sixty days written notice termination right** hub entity. [1][7][12]  \n- Contoso Ltd. is the Owner and Fabrikam Inc. is the Agent\u2019s principal broker, so these notice duties run between those parties. [7][12]\n\n---\n\n## 2. Builders Limited Warranty with Arbitration (Fabrikam Inc. \u2013 Contoso Ltd.)\n\n### a. Written notice of warranty claims (including certified mail)\n\n- Any warranty claim must be \u201cmade in writing as provided herein\u201d within the applicable **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) days** warranty periods; otherwise it is not covered. [5][10]  \n  - The text states: \u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d [5][10]\n- The Buyer/Owner must \u201cwrite a letter describing the defect to the Builder and **send it by certified mail return receipt requested** to the Builder at the Builder\u2019s office address below.\u201d [5][10]  \n  - This is an explicit **written notice** mechanism specifying:\n    - Form: **letter** [5][10]  \n    - Delivery method: **certified mail return receipt requested** [5][10]  \n    - Recipient: Builder (Fabrikam Inc.) at its office address (1820 Summit Ridge Dr., Pocatello, ID 83201). [5][10]\n\n### b. Required content and follow\u2011up communication\n\n- The Buyer/Owner must tell the Builder \u201c**in writing** what times during the day that the Buyer/Owner will be at home, so that the Builder can schedule service calls appropriately.\u201d [5][10]  \n  - This is a second written communication requirement, specifying content (available times). [5][10]\n\n### c. Emergency phone notice\n\n- \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must **telephone the Builder immediately**.\u201d [5][10]  \n  - Only emergency reports will be taken by phone: \u201cOnly emergency reports will be taken by phone.\u201d [5][10]  \n  - Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency \u201crelieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.\u201d [5][10]  \n  - This is an explicit **phone-based notice** mechanism for emergencies, distinct from the written certified-mail process for non\u2011emergency defects. [5][10]\n\n### d. Arbitration / court filings and preserved remedies (procedural \u201cdelivery\u201d mechanisms)\n\n- Disputes (other than small-claims-level matters) are resolved by **binding arbitration** administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or another mutually agreeable administrator. [5][10][13]  \n  - Arbitration is initiated \u201cupon the demand of a party hereto made before the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.\u201d [5][10]  \n  - This references **service of a complaint** and related pleadings, which are formal legal delivery/filing mechanisms, though the document does not detail the service method. [5][10]\n- The clause preserves the right to pursue certain **provisional or ancillary remedies** in court, including:\n  - \u201cinjunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim & delivery, replevin, garnishment, or the appointment of a receiver from a court having jurisdiction.\u201d [13][14][15][16]  \n  - These are all court-based remedies that inherently involve formal filings and service, though the contract does not specify the exact service method; it simply preserves the right to obtain them. [13][14][15][16]\n\n### e. Entire Agreement / modification mechanism\n\n- The warranty includes an **Entire Agreement clause**:  \n  - \u201cThis Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty and Statement of Non-Warranted Conditions constitute the entire integrated agreement and understanding between the parties, superseding all prior communications, oral or written.\u201d [13][14]  \n  - \u201cNo modifications to the Agreement shall be effective or binding unless in writing over the duly authorized signatures of the parties hereto.\u201d [13][14]  \n  - This is an explicit requirement that any modification must be **in writing** and signed, which is a form of written \u201cdelivery\u201d of contractual changes. [13][14]\n\n**Connection to hub entities:**  \n- The **Entire Agreement clause** hub entity is directly reflected in the language above, which governs how any notices or modifications must be documented (in writing, signed). [13][14]  \n- The **provisional or ancillary remedies** hub entity is explicitly listed (injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim & delivery, replevin, garnishment, appointment of a receiver) as preserved court remedies outside arbitration. [13][15][16]  \n- **Claim and delivery** is specifically named as one of these remedies. [13][15][16]  \n- Contoso Ltd. (Buyer/Owner) and Fabrikam Inc. (Builder) are the parties who must use these notice and delivery mechanisms. [5][10]\n\n---\n\n## 3. Purchase Contract (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2013 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\n### a. Delivery of goods (timeline and conditions)\n\n- Delivery is expected \u201c**8\u201310 weeks after drawing approval**.\u201d [3][4][9]  \n  - This is a delivery **timeline** mechanism tied to the event of drawing approval. [3][4][9]\n- Delay causes include \u201cfactory and permits.\u201d [3][4][9]  \n  - These are explicitly identified as potential causes of delivery delay. [3][4][9]\n\n### b. Payment tied to delivery\n\n- Payment terms include \u201c**$7,000.00 upon delivery**\u201d as the second of three installments. [3][4][9]  \n  - While not a notice mechanism, this is a contractual obligation triggered by the delivery event. [3][4][9]\n\n### c. Changes and written agreement\n\n- \u201cAny changes must be agreed to **in writing** and will affect the next payment milestone.\u201d [3][4][9]  \n  - This is an explicit requirement that changes be documented in writing, functioning as a written \u201cdelivery\u201d of change orders between Contoso Lifts LLC and Fabrikam Inc.

Assignment and written consent\n\n- \u201cNeither party may assign this contract without the other\u2019s **written consent**.\u201d [3][4][9]  \n  - This is another explicit written communication requirement: assignment is only valid if consent is given in writing. [3][4][9]\n\n### e. Right to cancel (time-bound notice)\n\n- \u201cCustomer may cancel within **3 business days** for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d [3][4][9]  \n  - The contract sets a **3 business day** window for cancellation, but it does not specify the form (written vs. oral) or delivery method of the cancellation notice. [3][4][9]\n\n**Connection to hub entities:**  \n- The **Delivery** hub entity is reflected in the \u201cDelivery expected 8\u201310 weeks after drawing approval\u201d clause and the identification of factory and permits as delay causes. [3][4][9]  \n- The **$7,000.00 upon delivery** hub entity is the payment milestone tied to the delivery event. [3][4][9]  \n- Contoso Lifts LLC is the Contractor and Fabrikam Inc. is the Customer in this contract. [3][4][9]\n\n---\n\n## 4. Contoso Lifts LLC Invoice\n\n### a.

Box 123567 Key West, FL. 33304-0708.\u201d [2][8]  \n  - This is a postal address that can function as a delivery point for mailed communications (e.g., checks, correspondence), though the invoice does not explicitly label it as a notice address.

Owner\u2019s notice obligations to Agent\n\n- The Owner must **\u201cProvide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.\u201d**[1][7][12]  \n  - This is a written notice requirement with a **5 business day** deadline after entering a listing agreement.[1][7][12]\n- The Owner must also **\u201cnotify Agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.\u201d**[1][7][12]  \n  - This is an explicit obligation to notify (form not specified, but clearly a notice mechanism) before granting access to third parties.[1][7][12]\n\n### c. Entire Agreement / integration (relevant to notice of modifications)\n\n- The agreement states: **\u201cThis is the entire Agreement between the parties\u201d** and it is **\u201cgoverned by the laws of the State of Hawaii.\u201d**[1][7][12]  \n  - While it does not spell out a specific notice method for amendments, it confirms that any obligations (including notice obligations) must be found in this written agreement.[1][7][12]\n\n**Connections:**  \n- The **\u201csixty (60) days written notice\u201d** termination right is the key explicit notice mechanism in this agreement and is directly tied to the \u201cSixty days written notice termination right\u201d hub entity.[1][7][12]\n\n---\n\n## 2. BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION\n\n### a. Written notice of warranty claims\n\n- The warranty states that **\u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d**[5][10]  \n  - This creates a requirement that warranty claims must be **made in writing** within either **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) days**, depending on the coverage.[5][10]\n\n- Under **\u201cNotification of Defects\u201d**, the Buyer/Owner must **\u201cwrite a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder's office address below.\u201d**[5][10]  \n  - This is an explicit **written notice** mechanism:\n    - Form: **letter describing the defect**.[5][10]  \n    - Delivery method: **\u201ccertified mail return receipt requested.\u201d**[5][10]  \n    - Recipient: Builder (Fabrikam Inc.) at **1820 Summit Ridge Dr., Pocatello, ID 83201**.[5][10]  \n  - This is the clearest certified-mail requirement in the corpus and directly implements the \u201cnotice\u201d requirement referenced in the earlier clause.[5][10]\n\n### b.

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Short Term and/or Vacation/Holiday Rentals)\n\n**Document scope and parties**\n\n- The \u201cPROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT\u201d is between **Contoso Ltd.** as \u201cOwner\u201d and **Walt Flood Realty** as \u201cAgent\u201d for a rental property at **456 Palm Tree Avenue, Honolulu, HI 96815** (Pacific View Retreat, Unit B202).[2][5][10]\n\n### 2.1.

Where such clauses do *not* exist\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT (Contoso Ltd. \u2013 Fabrikam Inc., 123 Mockup Lane, WI)**  \n  - No explicit insurance requirement, no hold harmless clause, and no indemnity obligation between owner and pumper.[1][4][9]\n\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION (Fabrikam Inc. \u2013 Contoso Ltd.)**  \n  - No explicit insurance requirement and no hold harmless/indemnity clause. Liability is limited via warranty exclusions (e.g., no consequential damages; no coverage for bodily injury or damage to non\u2011home property), but this is not an indemnity promise by Contoso Ltd.[3][11]\n\n- **Contoso Lifts LLC \u2013 INVOICE #1256003**  \n  - No insurance, indemnity, or hold harmless language; purely an invoice.[6][12]\n\n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2013 Fabrikam Inc.)**  \n  - Contains a **Risk of Loss** allocation (\u201cContractor holds risk until delivery.

            "text": "Below is a document\u2011by\u2011document summary of all explicit **insurance / indemnity / hold harmless** provisions, with cross\u2011references and all numeric values preserved.\n\n---\n\n## 1. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Short Term and/or Vacation/Holiday Rentals)\n\n### 1.1. Liability Insurance Requirement\n\nThe **Owner (Contoso Ltd.)** is expressly required to maintain liability insurance on the rental property. The agreement states that the Owner must:\n\n- \u201cProvide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of **$300,000** for bodily injury and **$25,000** for property damage to others.\u201d [2][5][10]  \n- Name the **Agent (Walt Flood Realty)** as an **additional insured** on this policy. [2][5][10]  \n- Furnish the Agent with **a copy of the insurance policy** and **a certificate of insurance**. [2][5][10]\n\nThese obligations are part of the \u201cRESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER\u201d section and are directly tied to the Owner\u2019s duty to protect the Agent from liability exposure arising from the property. [2][5][10]\n\n**Connection to indemnity/hold harmless:**  \nThe requirement that the Agent be named as an additional insured and receive proof of coverage supports the later **hold harmless and indemnification** clause by ensuring there is insurance backing for claims that the Owner must cover or indemnify. [2][5][10][13][14]\n\n---\n\n### 1.2. Hold Harmless and Indemnification Clause\n\nUnder the heading **\u201cHOLD HARMLESS\u201d**, the agreement contains an explicit limitation of liability and indemnity obligation in favor of the Agent:\n\n- The Owner agrees that the **Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property** subject to the agreement. [2][5][13][14]  \n- This limitation has an exception: it **does not apply** to \u201closs or injury caused by Agent's **gross negligence** or **wilful misconduct**.\u201d [2][5][13][14]  \n- The Owner must **\u201chold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability\u201d** (i.e., any claim for loss or injury on the property that is not caused by the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct). [2][5][13][14]\n\nIn effect:\n\n- The Agent is contractually shielded from most claims arising from the property. [2][5][13][14]  \n- The Owner assumes responsibility to **defend and reimburse** (indemnify) the Agent for those claims, except where the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct is the cause. [2][5][13][14]\n\n**Cross\u2011reference to insurance:**  \nBecause the Owner must carry liability insurance with specified minimum limits and name the Agent as an additional insured, that insurance is intended to respond to the same types of claims for which the Owner has agreed to hold the Agent harmless and indemnify the Agent. [2][5][10][13][14]\n\n**Cross\u2011reference to entities:**  \n- The Owner is **Contoso Ltd.** [2][5]  \n- The Agent is **Walt Flood Realty**, a Hawaii sole proprietorship. [2][5]  \n- The property is \u201c456 Palm Tree Avenue, Honolulu, HI 96815,\u201d known as **Pacific View Retreat, Unit B202**. [2][5]\n\n---\n\n## 2. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT (123 Mockup Lane, Washburn County, WI)\n\nThe **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** between **Contoso Ltd.** (Owner) and **Fabrikam Inc.** (Pumper) for holding tank(s) at **123 Mockup Lane, Washburn County, WI** sets out servicing and reporting obligations but **does not contain any explicit insurance, indemnity, or hold harmless clause** in the provided text. [1][4][9]\n\nKey points (to confirm absence of such clauses):\n\n- The Owner must file a copy of the contract with the County of Washburn under **WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5**. [1][4][9]  \n- The Owner must allow access, maintain an all\u2011weather access road, and pay charges for servicing. [1][4][9]  \n- The Pumper must submit detailed servicing reports to the County (including dates, volumes in gallons, disposal sites, and condition of the holding tank and components). [1][4][9]  \n- The agreement remains in effect until terminated, with a **ten (10) business day** deadline to file changes with the municipality and County. [1][4][9]\n\nNone of these provisions allocate liability via **hold harmless**, **indemnity**, or **insurance** language in the excerpts provided. [1][4][9]\n\n---\n\n## 3. BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION\n\nThe **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty** is between **Fabrikam Inc.** (Builder) and **Contoso Ltd.** (Buyer/Owner) for a home at **480 Willow Glen Drive, Chubbuck, ID 83202**. [3][11]  \n\nWhile this document does not use the words \u201chold harmless\u201d or \u201cindemnify,\u201d it contains **liability\u2011limiting provisions** that function similarly by excluding certain categories of damages and claims from the Builder\u2019s responsibility. [3][11]\n\n### 3.1. Exclusion of Certain Damages and Claims\n\nUnder \u201cExclusions from Coverage,\u201d the Builder expressly **does not assume responsibility** for several categories, including:\n\n- **\u201cCONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES\u201d** (with a note that some states do not allow such exclusions). [3][11]  \n- Defects or damage covered by manufacturers\u2019 warranties. [3][11]  \n- Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, or non\u2011residential use. [3][11]  \n- Defects due to characteristics of materials (e.g., warping of wood, checking of paint, cracking of concrete, stucco, plaster, bricks, masonry, and drying/shrinking of caulking). [3][11]  \n- Defects in materials or items installed by the Buyer/Owner or others not selected by the Builder. [3][11]  \n- Work by the Buyer/Owner or others not selected by the Builder. [3][11]  \n- Loss or damage caused by insects, animals, fire, explosion, smoke, water escape, ground water/soil movement, glass breakage, wind storm, hail, lightning, falling trees, aircraft, vehicles, flood, earthquakes, or acts of God. [3][11]  \n- Conditions from condensation, expansion, or contraction of materials. [3][11]  \n- Claims not made in writing within the applicable **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) day** warranty periods. [3][11]  \n- Damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification. [3][11]  \n- Defects in items not part of the original home as constructed by the Builder, or defects worsened by negligence, improper maintenance, lack of maintenance, improper action/inaction, or willful/malicious acts by parties other than the Builder, its employees, agents, or subcontractors. [3][11]  \n- **\u201cBodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.\u201d** [3][11]  \n- Any item listed as a non\u2011warrantable condition on the Statement of Non\u2011Warranted Conditions. [3][11]\n\nThese exclusions effectively **limit the Builder\u2019s liability** and shift the risk of many types of loss (including bodily injury and damage to non\u2011home property) away from the Builder, though they are framed as warranty exclusions rather than an affirmative indemnity obligation on the Buyer/Owner. [3][11]\n\n### 3.2. Disclaimer of Other Warranties\n\nThe warranty states that it is the **only** warranty provided by the Builder and that **all other warranties**, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, habitability, and good workmanship, are **disclaimed**. [3][11]  \n\nThis further narrows the Builder\u2019s exposure but does **not** create a hold harmless or indemnity obligation in favor of the Builder; it simply limits what the Buyer/Owner can claim under warranty. [3][11]\n\n### 3.3. No Explicit Insurance or Indemnity Requirement\n\nThe document:\n\n- Does **not** require the Buyer/Owner to maintain insurance for the Builder\u2019s benefit. [3][11]  \n- Does **not** contain language that the Buyer/Owner must \u201chold harmless\u201d or \u201cindemnify\u201d the Builder. [3][11]\n\nThus, while it is a liability\u2011limiting instrument, it is **not** an indemnity/hold harmless clause in the same sense as the Property Management Agreement. [3][11]\n\n---\n\n## 4. PURCHASE CONTRACT (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2013 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\nThe **Purchase Contract** between **Contoso Lifts LLC** (Contractor) and **Fabrikam Inc.** (Customer) governs the furnishing and installation of a vertical platform lift system (AscendPro VPX200 and related components) for a total price of **$29,900.00**. [7][8]\n\nRelevant sections:\n\n- **Risk of Loss:** \u201cContractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.\u201d [7][8]  \n- **Customer Default:** Failure to pay may result in legal action, and legal fees are recoverable by Contractor. [7][8]\n\nThese provisions allocate **risk of loss** and allow recovery of legal fees but:\n\n- Do **not** require either party to maintain insurance for the other. [7][8]  \n- Do **not** include any \u201chold harmless\u201d or \u201cindemnify\u201d language. [7][8]\n\nTherefore, there is **no explicit insurance / indemnity / hold harmless clause** in the Purchase Contract as provided. [7][8]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Contoso Lifts LLC Invoice (INVOICE #1256003)\n\nThe **invoice** from **Contoso Lifts LLC** to **Fabrikam Construction** for elevator/lift equipment totaling **$29,900.00** is a billing document. [6][12]\n\n- It lists items (e.g., Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504), operation parts, cab, outdoor fitting, aluminum door, hall call stations) and prices, with **SUBTOTAL 29900.00**, **TAX N/A**, **TOTAL 29900.00**, **AMOUNT DUE 29900.00**. [6][12]  \n- It includes payment instructions and contact information. [6][12]\n\nThe invoice contains **no insurance, indemnity, or hold harmless language**. [6][12]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross\u2011Document Connections and Overall Summary\n\n1. **Only one document contains an explicit hold harmless and indemnity clause:**  \n   - The **Property Management Agreement** requires the Owner (Contoso Ltd.) to **hold the Agent (Walt Flood Realty) harmless and indemnify the Agent** for claims for loss or injury to persons or property on the managed property, except where caused by the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct. [2][5][13][14]\n\n2. **That same agreement also contains the only explicit insurance requirement tied to indemnity:**\n   - The Owner must maintain liability insurance with minimum limits of **$300,000** (bodily injury) and **$25,000** (property damage to others), name the Agent as an additional insured, and provide a copy of the policy and a certificate of insurance. [2][5][10]  \n   - This insurance obligation is structurally aligned with the hold harmless/indemnity clause to ensure coverage for the risks the Owner assumes on behalf of the Agent. [2][5][10][13][14]\n\n3. **Other documents limit liability but do not create indemnity/hold harmless duties:**\n   - The **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty** between Fabrikam Inc. and Contoso Ltd. excludes consequential or incidental damages and various categories of defects and losses (including bodily injury and damage to non\u2011home property), thereby limiting the Builder\u2019s liability but not requiring the Buyer/Owner to indemnify or hold the Builder harmless. [3][11]  \n   - The **Purchase Contract** between Contoso Lifts LLC and Fabrikam Inc. allocates risk of loss (Contractor until delivery, Customer thereafter) and allows recovery of legal fees upon Customer default, but it does not include any hold harmless, indemnity, or insurance requirement. [7][8]  \n   - The **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** and the **Contoso Lifts invoice** contain no explicit insurance, indemnity, or hold harmless clauses in the provided text. [1][4][6][9][12]\n\n4. **Entity relationships:**\n   - **Contoso Ltd.** appears as Owner/Buyer in multiple documents: Holding Tank Servicing Contract (Owner of holding tank property at 123 Mockup Lane, WI) [1][4][9], Property Management Agreement (Owner of Pacific View Retreat, Honolulu) [2][5], and Buyer/Owner in the Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty (home at 480 Willow Glen Drive, ID). [3][11]  \n   - **Fabrikam Inc.** appears as Pumper in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract [1][4][9], Builder in the Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty [3][11], and Customer in the Purchase Contract with Contoso Lifts LLC. [7][8]  \n   - **Contoso Lifts LLC** appears as Contractor in the Purchase Contract and as the invoicing party in INVOICE #1256003, but without any indemnity/insurance clauses in those documents. [6][7][8][12]\n\n**Net conclusion:**  \nAcross all retrieved documents, the **only explicit \u201cinsurance / indemnity / hold harmless\u201d clause** is in the **Property Management Agreement**, where Contoso Ltd. must (a) carry specified liability insurance naming the Agent as additional insured and (b) hold harmless and indemnify the Agent for most claims arising from the property, except those caused by the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct.

furnish the agent with a copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance. 2510 these obligations are part of the responsibilities of owner section and are directly tied to the owners duty to protect the agent from liability exposure arising from the property. 2510 connection to indemnity/hold harmless: the requirement that the agent be named as an additional insured and receive proof of coverage supports the later hold harmless and indemnification clause by ensuring there is insurance backing for claims that the owner must cover or indemnify. 25101314 ---  1.2. hold harmless and indemnification clause under the heading hold harmless the agreement contains an explicit limitation of liability and indemnity obligation in favor of the agent: - the owner agrees that the agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to the agreement. 251314 - this limitation has an exception: it does not apply to loss or injury caused by agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct. 251314 - the owner must hold agent harmless and indemnify agent for any such claim or liability i.e. any claim for loss or injury on the property that is not caused by the agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct. 251314 in effect: - the agent is contractually shielded from most claims arising from the property. 251314 - the owner assumes responsibility to defend and reimburse indemnify the agent for those claims except where the agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct is the cause. 251314 crossreference to insurance: because the owner must carry liability insurance with specified minimum limits and name the agent as an additional insured that insurance is intended to respond to the same types of claims for which the owner has agreed to hold the agent harmless and indemnify the agent. 25101314 crossreference to entities: - the owner is contoso ltd. 25 - the agent is walt flood realty a hawaii sole proprietorship. 25 - the property is 456 palm tree avenue honolulu hi 96815 known as pacific view retreat unit b202. 25 ---  2. holding tank servicing contract 123 mockup lane washburn county wi the holding tank servicing contract between contoso ltd. owner and fabrikam inc. pumper for holding tanks at 123 mockup lane washburn county wi sets out servicing and reporting obligations but does not contain any explicit insurance indemnity or hold harmless clause in the provided text. 149 key points to confirm absence of such clauses: - the owner must file a copy of the contract with the county of washburn under wi code sps 383.2125. 149 - the owner must allow access maintain an allweather access road and pay charges for servicing. 149 - the pumper must submit detailed servicing reports to the county including dates volumes in gallons disposal sites and condition of the holding tank and components. 149 - the agreement remains in effect until terminated with a ten 10 business day deadline to file changes with the municipality and county. 149 none of these provisions allocate liability via hold harmless indemnity or insurance language in the excerpts provided. 149 ---  3. builders limited warranty with arbitration the builders limited warranty is between fabrikam inc. builder and contoso ltd. buyer/owner for a home at 480 willow glen drive chubbuck id 83202. 311 while this document does not use the words hold harmless or indemnify it contains liabilitylimiting provisions that function similarly by excluding certain categories of damages and claims from the builders responsibility. 311  3.1. exclusion of certain damages and claims under exclusions from coverage the builder expressly does not assume responsibility for several categories including: - consequential or incidental damages with a note that some states do not allow such exclusions. 311 - defects or damage covered by manufacturers warranties. 311 - damage from ordinary wear and tear abuse neglect lack of maintenance or nonresidential use. 311 - defects due to characteristics of materials e.g. warping of wood checking of paint cracking of concrete stucco plaster bricks masonry and drying/shrinking of caulking. 311 - defects in materials or items installed by the buyer/owner or others not selected by the builder. 311 - work by the buyer/owner or others not selected by the builder. 311 - loss or damage caused by insects animals fire explosion smoke water escape ground water/soil movement glass breakage wind storm hail lightning falling trees aircraft vehicles flood earthquakes or acts of god. 311 - conditions from condensation expansion or contraction of materials. 311 - claims not made in writing within the applicable one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty periods. 311 - damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification. 311 - defects in items not part of the original home as constructed by the builder or defects worsened by negligence improper maintenance lack of maintenance improper action/inaction or willful/malicious acts by parties other than the builder its employees agents or subcontractors. 311 - bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by builder. 311 - any item listed as a nonwarrantable condition on the statement of nonwarranted conditions. 311 these exclusions effectively limit the builders liability and shift the risk of many types of loss including bodily injury and damage to nonhome property away from the builder though they are framed as warranty exclusions rather than an affirmative indemnity obligation on the buyer/owner. 311  3.2. disclaimer of other warranties the warranty states that it is the only warranty provided by the builder and that all other warranties including implied warranties of merchantability fitness for a particular purpose habitability and good workmanship are disclaimed. 311 this further narrows the builders exposure but does not create a hold harmless or indemnity obligation in favor of the builder it simply limits what the buyer/owner can claim under warranty. 311  3.3. no explicit insurance or indemnity requirement the document: - does not require the buyer/owner to maintain insurance for the builders benefit. 311 - does not contain language that the buyer/owner must hold harmless or indemnify the builder. 311 thus while it is a liabilitylimiting instrument it is not an indemnity/hold harmless clause in the same sense as the property management agreement. 311 ---  4. purchase contract contoso lifts llc  fabrikam inc. the purchase contract between contoso lifts llc contractor and fabrikam inc. customer governs the furnishing and installation of a vertical platform lift system ascendpro vpx200 and related components for a total price of $29900.00. 78 relevant sections: - risk of loss: contractor holds risk until delivery. customer holds risk thereafter. 78 - customer default: failure to pay may result in legal action and legal fees are recoverable by contractor. 78 these provisions allocate risk of loss and allow recovery of legal fees but: - do not require either party to maintain insurance for the other. 78 - do not include any hold harmless or indemnify language. 78 therefore there is no explicit insurance / indemnity / hold harmless clause in the purchase contract as provided. 78 ---  5. contoso lifts llc invoice invoice 1256003 the invoice from contoso lifts llc to fabrikam construction for elevator/lift equipment totaling $29900.00 is a billing document. 612 - it lists items e.g. vertical platform lift savaria v1504 operation parts cab outdoor fitting aluminum door hall call stations and prices with subtotal 29900.00 tax n/a total 29900.00 amount due 29900.00. 612 - it includes payment instructions and contact information. 612 the invoice contains no insurance indemnity or hold harmless language. 612 ---  6. crossdocument connections and overall summary 1. only one document contains an explicit hold harmless and indemnity clause: - the property management agreement requires the owner contoso ltd. to hold the agent walt flood realty harmless and indemnify the agent for claims for loss or injury to persons or property on the managed property except where caused by the agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct. 251314 2. that same agreement also contains the only explicit insurance requirement tied to indemnity: - the owner must maintain liability insurance with minimum limits of $300000 bodily injury and $25000 property damage to others name the agent as an additional insured and provide a copy of the policy and a certificate of insurance. 2510 - this insurance obligation is structurally aligned with the hold harmless/indemnity clause to ensure coverage for the risks the owner assumes on behalf of the agent. 25101314 3. other documents limit liability but do not create indemnity/hold harmless duties: - the builders limited warranty between fabrikam inc. and contoso ltd. excludes consequential or incidental damages and various categories of defects and losses including bodily injury and damage to nonhome property thereby limiting the builders liability but not requiring the buyer/owner to indemnify or hold the builder harmless. 311 - the purchase contract between contoso lifts llc and fabrikam inc. allocates risk of loss contractor until delivery customer thereafter and allows recovery of legal fees upon customer default but it does not include any hold harmless indemnity or insurance requirement. 78 - the holding tank servicing contract and the contoso lifts invoice contain no explicit insurance indemnity or hold harmless clauses in the provided text. 146912 4. entity relationships: - contoso ltd. appears as owner/buyer in multiple documents: holding tank servicing contract owner of holding tank property at 123 mockup lane wi 149 property management agreement owner of pacific view retreat honolulu 25 and buyer/owner in the builders limited warranty home at 480 willow glen drive id. 311 - fabrikam inc. appears as pumper in the holding tank servicing contract 149 builder in the builders limited warranty 311 and customer in the purchase contract with contoso lifts llc. 78 - contoso lifts llc appears as contractor in the purchase contract and as the invoicing party in invoice 1256003 but without any indemnity/insurance clauses in those documents. 67812 net conclusion: across all retrieved documents the only explicit insurance / indemnity / hold harmless clause is in the property management agreement where contoso ltd. must a carry specified liability insurance naming the agent as additional insured and b hold harmless and indemnify the agent for most claims arising from the property except those caused by the agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct. 25101314"

PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Short Term and/or Vacation/Holiday Rentals)\n\n### 1.1. Liability Insurance Requirement\n\n- The **Owner (Contoso Ltd.)** is expressly required to **\u201cProvide Liability Insurance coverage for the property\u201d** being managed under the agreement. [2][5][10]  \n- The policy must have **minimum limits of \u201c$300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others.\u201d** [2][5][10]  \n- The **Agent (Walt Flood Realty)** must be **\u201cnamed as additional insured\u201d** on this liability policy. [2][5][10]  \n- The Owner must furnish the Agent with **\u201ca copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance.\u201d** [2][5][10]  \n\nThese insurance obligations are part of the Owner\u2019s responsibilities and are directly tied to the risk allocation between Owner and Agent. [2][5][10]\n\n### 1.2. Hold Harmless and Indemnification Clause\n\n- The agreement contains an explicit **\u201cHOLD HARMLESS\u201d** clause. [2][5][13][14]  \n- Under this clause, **\u201cThe Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct.\u201d** [2][5][13][14]  \n- The clause further states that the **Owner \u201cshall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.\u201d** [2][5][13][14]  \n\n**Effect of the clause:**\n\n- The Agent is broadly released from liability for **claims for loss or injury to persons or property on the managed property**, except where the claim arises from the Agent\u2019s **\u201cgross negligence or wilful misconduct.\u201d** [2][5][13][14]  \n- The Owner must **indemnify** (reimburse and protect) the Agent against such claims or liabilities that are not caused by the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct. [2][5][13][14]  \n\n### 1.3. Connection Between Insurance and Hold Harmless\n\n- The Owner\u2019s obligation to carry liability insurance with specified minimum limits and to name the Agent as an additional insured [2][5][10] supports the risk allocation in the hold harmless clause, where the Owner assumes responsibility for most claims and must indemnify the Agent. [2][5][13][14]  \n- Both obligations apply to the same property that the Agent manages on the Owner\u2019s behalf (the rental property at 456 Palm Tree Avenue, Honolulu, HI 96815, \u201cPacific View Retreat,\u201d Unit B202). [2][5][10]  \n\n---\n\n## 2. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT (123 Mockup Lane, Washburn County, WI)\n\n- The **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** between **Contoso Ltd. (Owner)** and **Fabrikam Inc. (Pumper)** sets out obligations regarding filing the contract with Washburn County, servicing access, maintenance of an all\u2011weather access road, payment for services, and reporting requirements to the County. [1][4][9]  \n- The contract text provided **does not contain any explicit insurance, indemnity, or hold harmless clause**:  \n  - It addresses filing requirements under **WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5**. [1][4][9]  \n  - It covers the Owner\u2019s duty to allow access and maintain the access road and to pay charges for servicing. [1][4][9]  \n  - It covers the Pumper\u2019s duty to submit detailed service reports (including dates, volumes pumped, disposal sites, and condition of the holding tank and components). [1][4][9]  \n  - It describes the term and termination/change\u2011filing obligations. [1][4][9]  \n- No clause in the provided text uses terms such as **\u201chold harmless,\u201d \u201cindemnify,\u201d \u201cindemnification,\u201d** or **\u201cliability insurance\u201d**, nor any equivalent language shifting liability or requiring insurance coverage. [1][4][9]  \n\nThus, **there is no explicit insurance / indemnity / hold harmless clause in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract as provided.** [1][4][9]\n\n---\n\n## 3. BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION\n\n- The **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty** between **Fabrikam Inc. (Builder)** and **Contoso Ltd. (Buyer/Owner)** focuses on warranty coverage, exclusions, and arbitration. [3][11]  \n- The document contains **extensive exclusions** of responsibility, including:  \n  - Exclusion of **\u201cCONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES\u201d**. [3][11]  \n  - Exclusion of coverage for **bodily injury or damage to personal property or to real property not part of the original home**. [3][11]  \n  - Disclaimers of all other warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, habitability, and good workmanship. [3][11]  \n- However, in the text provided, the warranty **does not include an explicit \u201chold harmless\u201d or \u201cindemnification\u201d clause** in which one party agrees to defend or reimburse the other for third\u2011party claims. [3][11]  \n- The document also **does not impose an explicit requirement to obtain liability insurance** or to name any party as an additional insured. [3][11]  \n\nTherefore, while the warranty **limits and excludes certain liabilities**, it **does not contain an explicit insurance / indemnity / hold harmless clause** comparable to the Property Management Agreement\u2019s hold harmless provision. [3][11]\n\n---\n\n## 4. PURCHASE CONTRACT (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2013 Fabrikam Inc.)\n\n- The **Purchase Contract** between **Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor)** and **Fabrikam Inc. (Customer)** governs the furnishing and installation of a vertical platform lift and related components. [7][8]  \n- It includes provisions on **scope of work, payment terms, customer default, risk of loss, delivery, applicable law, assignment, warranty, permitting, and right to cancel.** [7][8]  \n- The contract explicitly allocates **risk of loss**:  \n  - **\u201cContractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.\u201d** [7][8]  \n- Despite this risk allocation, the contract text provided **does not contain any clause labeled \u201chold harmless,\u201d \u201cindemnity,\u201d or \u201cindemnification,\u201d** nor language requiring one party to defend or reimburse the other for third\u2011party claims. [7][8]  \n- The contract also **does not require either party to obtain liability insurance** or to name the other as an additional insured. [7][8]  \n\nThus, **no explicit insurance / indemnity / hold harmless clause appears in the Purchase Contract as provided.** [7][8]\n\n---\n\n## 5. Contoso Lifts LLC Invoice (INVOICE #1256003)\n\n- The **invoice** from **Contoso Lifts LLC** to **Fabrikam Construction** (INVOICE #1256003) lists equipment, prices, and payment instructions. [6][12]  \n- It includes line items such as a **\u201cVertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)\u201d** and related components, with a **subtotal of 29,900.00**, **tax \u201cN/A\u201d**, and **\u201cTOTAL 29900.00\u201d** and **\u201cAMOUNT DUE 29900.00.\u201d** [6][12]  \n- The invoice text **does not contain any insurance, indemnity, or hold harmless language**; it is limited to commercial billing terms and contact information. [6][12]  \n\nTherefore, **no explicit insurance / indemnity / hold harmless clause is present in the invoice.** [6][12]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Cross\u2011Document Connections and Overall Summary\n\n- **Contoso Ltd.** appears as:  \n  - The **Owner** in the **Property Management Agreement**, where it must provide liability insurance and hold the Agent harmless and indemnify the Agent, except for the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct. [2][5][10][13][14]  \n  - The **Holding Tank Owner** in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** for the property at **123 Mockup Lane, Washburn County, WI**, which does not include any explicit insurance or indemnity clause. [1][4][9]  \n  - The **Buyer/Owner** in the **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty**, which contains warranty limitations but no explicit indemnity or hold harmless clause. [3][11]  \n\n- **Fabrikam Inc.** appears as:  \n  - The **Pumper** in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract. [1][4][9]  \n  - The **Builder** in the Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty. [3][11]  \n  - The **Customer** in the Purchase Contract with Contoso Lifts LLC. [7][8]  \n  - The **construction customer** on the Contoso Lifts invoice. [6][12]  \n  None of these Fabrikam\u2011related documents include an explicit hold harmless or indemnity clause in the provided text. [1][3][4][6][7][8][9][11][12]\n\n- **Only one document\u2014the Property Management Agreement\u2014contains explicit insurance and hold harmless/indemnification language.** [2][5][10][13][14]  \n  - It requires the Owner to carry liability insurance with specified minimum limits and to name the Agent as an additional insured, and to provide proof of such insurance. [2][5][10]  \n  - It expressly states that the Agent is not liable for claims for loss or injury on the property except where caused by the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and that the Owner must hold the Agent harmless and indemnify the Agent for such claims or liabilities. [2][5][13][14]  \n\nAll other retrieved documents either allocate risk (e.g., risk of loss) or limit warranty coverage but **do not** contain explicit **insurance / indemnity / hold harmless** clauses in the text provided.

PURCHASE CONTRACT (Vertical Platform Lift)\n\n### 1.1. Forfeiture of Deposit on Late Cancellation\n\n- The purchase contract between Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor) and Fabrikam Inc. (Customer) includes a **\u201cRight to Cancel\u201d** clause. [5][6]  \n- Under this clause, the **Customer may cancel within 3 business days for a full refund**. [5][6]  \n- The same clause states that **after this 3\u2011business\u2011day period, the deposit is forfeited** (\u201cAfterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d). [5][6]  \n- The total contract price is **$29,900.00**, payable in three installments: **$20,000.00 upon signing**, **$7,000.00 upon delivery**, and **$2,900.00 upon completion**. [5][6]  \n- Because the first installment of **$20,000.00** is due \u201cupon signing,\u201d this amount functions as the **initial deposit** that is subject to forfeiture if the Customer cancels after the 3\u2011business\u2011day window. [5][6]  \n\n**Explicit forfeiture term:**  \n- If the Customer cancels **after** 3 business days from contract execution, the **deposit (initial payment of $20,000.00 upon signing)** is **forfeited**. [5][6]\n\n**Cross\u2011reference / relationships:**\n\n- The **Payment Terms** entity is directly tied to this forfeiture rule because the forfeited amount is the first installment under those payment terms. [5][6]  \n- The same parties (Contoso Lifts LLC and Fabrikam Inc.) also appear in the **EXHIBIT A \u2013 SCOPE OF WORK**, confirming the broader contractual relationship but not adding any separate non\u2011refund/forfeiture language. [15][16]\n\n---\n\n## 2. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Short Term and/or Vacation/Holiday Rentals)\n\n### 2.1. Non\u2011Refundable Agency Start\u2011Up Fee\n\n- The Property Management Agreement is between **Contoso Ltd.** (Owner) and **Walt Flood Realty** (Agent). [4][9][11]  \n- Under **\u201cAGENCY START\u2011UP FEE\u201d**, the Agreement states that **upon execution of the Agreement**, the Owner must pay **two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)** to the Agent. [11][12][13]  \n- This fee is explicitly described as a **\u201cnon\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee.\u201d** [11][12][13]  \n- The Agreement further explains that the Agent will use this **$250.00 non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee** to:\n  - Pay initial administrative expenses of including the premises in its rental program. [11][12][13]  \n  - Conduct a complete inventory of all furniture and furnishings in the rental unit. [11][12][13]  \n  - Produce a condition/inspection report of the premises, appliances, and contents. [11][12][13]  \n  - Pay other sums initially required for performance of its duties under the Agreement. [11][12][13]  \n\n**Explicit non\u2011refundable term:**  \n- The **Agency Start\u2011Up Fee of $250.00** is **non\u2011refundable**, regardless of later events (the Agreement uses the exact phrase \u201cnon\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee\u201d). [11][12][13]\n\n### 2.2. Related but Not Explicitly Non\u2011Refundable\n\n- The Agreement lists multiple **Agent\u2019s Fees**, including:\n  - **25%** of gross revenues for short\u2011term/vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days). [4][9][18]  \n  - **10%** of gross revenues for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days). [4][9][18]  \n  - Advertising charge of **$75.00/month** for short\u2011term rentals. [4][9][18]  \n  - Minimum administration/accounting charge of **$50.00/month**. [4][9][18]  \n  - **10%** fee on total charge for repairs, upgrades, renovations. [4][9][18]  \n  - **$35/hour** to schedule/escort contractors and similar personnel. [4][9][18]  \n  - Hawaii Gross Excise tax of **4.712%** on all fees, commissions, and charges. [4][9][18]  \n- These fees are not explicitly labeled as \u201cnon\u2011refundable\u201d or \u201cforfeited\u201d in the text; only the **start\u2011up fee** is expressly called **non\u2011refundable**. [11][12][13]\n\n**Cross\u2011reference / relationships:**\n\n- The **Automatic renewal for successive one year terms** clause provides that the Agreement runs for an initial 12\u2011month term starting **2010\u201106\u201115** and automatically renews for successive one\u2011year terms, with either party able to terminate on **60 days\u2019 written notice**. [4][9]  \n- This termination clause does **not** override or refund the **non\u2011refundable $250.00 start\u2011up fee**; the Agreement does not provide any mechanism to recover that fee upon termination. [4][9][11][12][13]  \n- The **long term leases** entity is defined here as leases of **more than 180 days**, which is relevant to the fee structure but not to non\u2011refundability. [18]\n\n---\n\n## 3. BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION\n\nThe **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty and Statement of Non\u2011Warranted Conditions** between **Fabrikam Inc.** (Builder) and **Contoso Ltd.** (Buyer/Owner) contains **limitations and exclusions of coverage**, but **no explicit \u201cnon\u2011refundable\u201d or \u201cforfeiture\u201d of payments** language. [1][3][7][10][17]\n\n### 3.1. Exclusions and Time\u2011Bar (Not Expressly Labeled Forfeiture)\n\n- The warranty term is **one (1) year** for major structural components and systems, and **sixty (60) days** for specified items like doors, windows, switches, and caulking. [1][3][7]  \n- The warranty states that **any claims not made in writing within the applicable one\u2011year or sixty\u2011day period are \u201cnot covered,\u201d regardless of discoverability** (\u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING \u2026 WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d). [3][7]  \n- Section 4 lists numerous **exclusions from coverage**, including:\n  - Consequential or incidental damages. [3][7]  \n  - Consumer products covered by manufacturers\u2019 warranties. [3][7]  \n  - Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, non\u2011residential use. [3][7]  \n  - Material characteristics (e.g., warping, cracking in curing concrete, etc.). [3][7]  \n  - Work or materials installed by the Buyer/Owner or others not selected by Builder. [3][7]  \n  - Loss or damage from insects, animals, fire, explosion, water escape, natural disasters, etc. [3][7]  \n  - Conditions from condensation, expansion, contraction. [3][7]  \n  - Claims not made in writing within the warranty period. [3][7]  \n  - Damages avoidable by prompt notification. [3][7]  \n  - Defects in items not part of the original home as constructed by Builder. [3][7]  \n  - Bodily injury or damage to non\u2011covered property. [3][7]  \n  - Any item listed as a non\u2011warrantable condition on the **Statement of Non\u2011Warranted Conditions**. [3][7][10][17]  \n- The warranty also disclaims all other warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, habitability, and good workmanship, and any warranty that might be construed to cover radon or other environmental pollutants. [3][7]\n\n**Important distinction:**  \n- These provisions **limit coverage** and **time\u2011bar claims**, but they do **not** explicitly state that any **fees or payments are non\u2011refundable** or that any **deposit is forfeited**. [1][3][7][10][17]  \n- Therefore, they are **not explicit non\u2011refund/forfeiture terms** in the same sense as the Property Management Agreement\u2019s start\u2011up fee or the Purchase Contract\u2019s deposit forfeiture.\n\n---\n\n## 4. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT\n\n- The Holding Tank Servicing Contract is between **Contoso Ltd.** (Owner) and **Fabrikam Inc.** (Pumper). [8][14]  \n- The Owner agrees to pay the Pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) \u201cas mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.\u201d [8][14]  \n- The contract states it remains in effect until terminated by owner or pumper, and that changes or a new service contract must be filed with the municipality and County within **ten (10) business days** of any change. [8][14]  \n\n**Non\u2011refund/forfeiture analysis:**\n\n- The document **does not contain any explicit language** describing any payment as **\u201cnon\u2011refundable\u201d** or any **\u201cforfeiture\u201d** of deposits or fees. [8][14]  \n- It only obligates the Owner to pay for services rendered and to allow access; there is no clause that a pre\u2011paid amount is lost upon termination or breach. [8][14]\n\n---\n\n## 5. CONTOSO LIFTS INVOICE\n\n- The invoice from **Contoso Lifts LLC** to **Fabrikam Construction** lists a total amount due of **$29,900.00**, matching the contract price in the Purchase Contract. [19][5][6]  \n- The invoice notes \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d and states that the **amount due is $29,900.00**. [19]  \n\n**Non\u2011refund/forfeiture analysis:**\n\n- The invoice itself **does not state** that any portion of the invoiced amount is **non\u2011refundable** or **forfeited**; it simply reflects the contract pricing and payment due. [19]  \n- The forfeiture rule still comes from the **Purchase Contract\u2019s** \u201cRight to Cancel\u201d clause, not from the invoice. [5][6][19]\n\n---\n\n## 6. Consolidated Answer to the Query\n\nAcross all retrieved documents, the **only explicit non\u2011refundable / forfeiture terms** are:\n\n1. **Non\u2011Refundable Agency Start\u2011Up Fee \u2013 Property Management Agreement**  \n   - Owner (Contoso Ltd.) must pay **$250.00** to Agent (Walt Flood Realty) upon execution of the Agreement as a **\u201cnon\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee.\u201d** [11][12][13]  \n   - This fee is used for initial administrative expenses, inventory, inspection reports, and other initial duties, and is **not refundable** under any stated circumstances. [11][12][13]  \n\n2. **Forfeiture of Deposit After 3\u2011Day Cancellation Window \u2013 Purchase Contract**  \n   - Customer (Fabrikam Inc.) may cancel the lift Purchase Contract within **3 business days** for a **full refund**. [5][6]  \n   - **After** this 3\u2011business\u2011day period, the **deposit is forfeited** (\u201cAfterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d). [5][6]  \n   - Given the Payment Terms, the **$20,000.00** due \u201cupon signing\u201d functions as the deposit that is subject to forfeiture if cancellation occurs after the 3\u2011day window. [5][6]  \n\nAll other documents (Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty, Holding Tank Servicing Contract, and the invoice) contain **limitations of coverage, obligations to pay, or time\u2011bar provisions**, but **no explicit \u201cnon\u2011refundable\u201d or \u201cforfeiture\u201d language** regarding payments or deposits.
