How are emergency defects defined and what notification channel is required?\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty states that if “an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst)” the Buyer/Owner must treat this as an emergency situation.[10][19] A burst pipe is explicitly given as an example of such an emergency.[10][19]\n\nFor these emergencies, the warranty specifies a different notification channel than for ordinary defects:\n\n- Ordinary (non‑emergency) defects: must be reported **in writing by certified mail, return receipt requested** to the Builder’s office address.[10][19]\n- **Emergency defects** (e.g., burst pipe): the Buyer/Owner **“must telephone the Builder immediately”** at the emergency number provided.[10][19]\n\nThe warranty further clarifies: “Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[10][19] Thus, for an emergency defect under the warranty, the required notification channel is **telephone**, using the Builder’s emergency number (listed as (208) 555‑2311).[10][19]\n\nNo email, online portal, or other channels are designated for emergency defect reporting; the contract is explicit that emergencies are to be reported by phone and that only emergencies may be reported that way.[10][19]\n\n### Q2. Timeframes and procedural steps for using the notification channel\n\nFor emergency defects:\n\n- **Timeframe:** The Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder **“immediately”** if an emergency exists or if delay will cause extra damage (e.g., a burst pipe).[10][19]\n- **Procedural steps:**\n  1. Recognize that an emergency exists or that delay will cause extra damage (the burst pipe example is given).[10][19]\n  2. **Telephone the Builder immediately** at the emergency number provided in the warranty.[10][19]\n  3. For non‑emergency defects, separately send a **written letter by certified mail, return receipt requested**, describing the defect and indicating times when the Buyer/Owner will be at home so the Builder can schedule service calls.[10][19]\n\nThe warranty does not specify a precise number of minutes or hours, but the use of “immediately” indicates that the call must be made without undue delay once the emergency is discovered.[10][19]\n\n### Q3. Consequences of delay: impact on coverage, liability, and repair obligations\n\nThe warranty expressly addresses the effect of delayed notification in emergencies:\n\n- Under the exclusions from coverage, the warranty excludes “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”[10][19]\n- In the emergency‑notification clause, it states:  \n  “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty **relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages**.”[10][19]\n\nTaken together:\n\n- **Coverage / liability:** If the Buyer/Owner does not promptly telephone the Builder about an emergency (such as a burst pipe), the Builder is **relieved of all liability** for:\n  - Replacement,\n  - Repair, and\n  - “All other damages” related to that emergency.[10][19]\n- **Repair obligations:** Because the Builder is relieved of liability for replacement and repair in that scenario, the Builder’s obligation to repair or replace the defective item at no charge (which otherwise applies when a covered defect is properly reported in writing)[10][19] effectively does not apply where there was a failure to promptly notify the Builder of the emergency.\n\nThus, delayed or non‑compliant notification of an emergency defect can result in the loss of warranty coverage for that event and its resulting damage.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The warranty distinguishes **ordinary defects** (reported in writing by certified mail) from **emergency defects** (reported by immediate telephone call).[10][19]\n- A burst pipe is explicitly identified as an example of an emergency where delay will cause extra damage, triggering the immediate‑phone‑call requirement.[10][19]\n- The same document that sets the emergency phone‑notification requirement also states that:\n  - Damages avoidable by prompt notification are excluded from coverage,[10][19]\n  - And failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and other damages.[10][19]\n- Therefore, the **required channel (phone)**, the **required timing (“immediately”)**, and the **consequence of delay (loss of coverage/liability)** are all tightly linked within the warranty terms.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Builders Limited Warranty, an emergency defect such as a burst pipe must be reported **immediately by telephone** to the Builder’s emergency number; only emergency reports are accepted by phone.[10][19] If the Buyer/Owner fails to promptly notify the Builder of such an emergency, any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are excluded from coverage, and the Builder is **relieved of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages** arising from that emergency.[10][19]",

Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[6]\n\nThus:\n- The **required channel for an emergency defect** is **telephone** (to the emergency number listed in the warranty).[6]\n- The party **expressly required** to report the emergency defect is the **Buyer/Owner**.[6]\n\n### Q2 & Q6 – Are there timeframes or deadlines for using the required channel?\n\nFor emergencies, the warranty states:\n\n- “If an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately.”[6]\n\n“Immediately” is the only timing language given for emergency phone notification. There is no specific number of hours or days, but the requirement is to call **without delay** once the emergency exists.\n\nSeparately, for all warranty claims (including those that may start as emergencies), the Buyer/Owner must still submit a **written claim within the warranty term**:\n\n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.”[2][3]\n- The written notice must be sent by certified mail before the end of the applicable warranty period.[6]\n\nSo, for an emergency defect:\n1. **Immediate phone call** to report the emergency.[6]\n2. **Written certified‑mail notice** within the applicable 1‑year or 60‑day warranty period to preserve coverage.[2][3][6]\n\n### Q3 & Q7 – What are the consequences of delay in using the required channel?\n\nThe warranty expressly addresses delay in emergency notification:\n\n- “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[6]\n\nAdditionally, in the exclusions section:\n\n- The warranty excludes “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”[4][2][3]\n\nConsequences of delay in emergency notice therefore include:\n\n1. **Loss of all liability on the Builder’s part** for:\n   - Replacement,\n   - Repair, and\n   - “All other damages” related to that emergency.[6]\n\n2. **Exclusion of avoidable damages**:\n   - Any damages that “could have been avoided by prompt notification” are not covered.[4][2][3]\n\n### Q4 & Q8 – Does delay affect the homeowner’s rights to coverage, repairs, or reimbursement, and how?\n\nYes. The contract ties prompt emergency notification directly to the Builder’s obligations:\n\n1. **Loss of warranty rights for the emergency event if notice is not prompt**  \n   Because “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency…relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages,”[6] the homeowner’s rights to:\n   - Have the emergency condition repaired or the defective item replaced at no charge, and\n   - Recover any related damages,\n   are effectively forfeited for that emergency if they do not promptly call.\n\n2. **Loss of coverage for damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice**  \n   The exclusions clause removes from coverage “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”[4][2][3]  \n   This means that even if some underlying defect might still be arguable, **any additional or consequential damage that grew worse because of delayed notice is excluded**.\n\n3. **Potential loss of coverage if written notice is not timely**  \n   Independently of the emergency phone requirement, the warranty states that any claims not made in writing within the applicable 1‑year or 60‑day period “are not covered.”[2][3]  \n   So if the homeowner:\n   - Fails to call immediately for an emergency, and/or\n   - Fails to send the required written certified‑mail notice within the warranty term,  \n   then the Builder has **no obligation** to repair, replace, or pay for that defect or related damages.\n\nIn practical terms, delay in using the required emergency channel (phone) can:\n\n- Completely eliminate the Builder’s liability for that emergency event (no repair, no replacement, no damages).[6]\n- Exclude from coverage any damage that got worse because the Builder was not promptly notified.[4][2][3]\n- Combined with failure to send timely written notice, result in the claim being entirely outside warranty coverage.[2][3][6]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The warranty sets up a **two‑step notice system**:\n  1. **Immediate phone call** for emergencies (e.g., burst pipe) so the Builder can act quickly.[6]\n  2. **Certified‑mail written notice** within the warranty period for all claims, including emergencies, to preserve formal coverage.[2][3][6]\n\n- The **emergency phone requirement** is tied directly to **liability**: if the homeowner does not promptly call, the Builder is relieved of “all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages” for that emergency.[6]\n\n- The **exclusions clause** reinforces this by denying coverage for “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification,”[4][2][3] making timeliness central to the homeowner’s ability to obtain repairs and reimbursement.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor an emergency defect under the Builders Limited Warranty—such as a burst pipe—the Buyer/Owner is required to **telephone the Builder immediately** at the listed emergency number; only emergency reports are accepted by phone.[6] Delay in making this emergency call has serious consequences: **failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages** related to that emergency,[6] and any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are excluded from coverage.[4][2][3] To maintain warranty rights, the homeowner must both call immediately for emergencies and also submit a written, certified‑mail claim within the applicable warranty period.",
            "text_norm": " analysis  q1  q5  what notification channel is required and who must use it the builders limited warranty specifies two different notification methods depending on whether the issue is an emergency: - general nonemergency defects: the buyer/owner mustwrite a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the builders office address.6 - emergency defects or situations where delay will cause extra damage e.g. burst pipe: if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage for instance a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately. only emergency reports will be taken by phone.6 thus: - the required channel for an emergency defect is telephone to the emergency number listed in the warranty.6 - the party expressly required to report the emergency defect is the buyer/owner.6  q2  q6  are there timeframes or deadlines for using the required channel for emergencies the warranty states: - if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage for instance a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately.6 immediately is the only timing language given for emergency phone notification. there is no specific number of hours or days but the requirement is to call without delay once the emergency exists. separately for all warranty claims including those that may start as emergencies the buyer/owner must still submit a written claim within the warranty term: - any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered.23 - the written notice must be sent by certified mail before the end of the applicable warranty period.6 so for an emergency defect: 1. immediate phone call to report the emergency.6 2. written certifiedmail notice within the applicable 1year or 60day warranty period to preserve coverage.236  q3  q7  what are the consequences of delay in using the required channel the warranty expressly addresses delay in emergency notification: - failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.6 additionally in the exclusions section: - the warranty excludes damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.423 consequences of delay in emergency notice therefore include: 1. loss of all liability on the builders part for: - replacement - repair and - all other damages related to that emergency.6 2. exclusion of avoidable damages: - any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are not covered.423  q4  q8  does delay affect the homeowners rights to coverage repairs or reimbursement and how yes. the contract ties prompt emergency notification directly to the builders obligations: 1. loss of warranty rights for the emergency event if notice is not prompt because failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergencyrelieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages6 the homeowners rights to: - have the emergency condition repaired or the defective item replaced at no charge and - recover any related damages are effectively forfeited for that emergency if they do not promptly call. 2. loss of coverage for damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice the exclusions clause removes from coverage damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.423 this means that even if some underlying defect might still be arguable any additional or consequential damage that grew worse because of delayed notice is excluded. 3. potential loss of coverage if written notice is not timely independently of the emergency phone requirement the warranty states that any claims not made in writing within the applicable 1year or 60day period are not covered.23 so if the homeowner: - fails to call immediately for an emergency and/or - fails to send the required written certifiedmail notice within the warranty term then the builder has no obligation to repair replace or pay for that defect or related damages. in practical terms delay in using the required emergency channel phone can: - completely eliminate the builders liability for that emergency event no repair no replacement no damages.6 - exclude from coverage any damage that got worse because the builder was not promptly notified.423 - combined with failure to send timely written notice result in the claim being entirely outside warranty coverage.236  key connections - the warranty sets up a twostep notice system: 1. immediate phone call for emergencies e.g. burst pipe so the builder can act quickly.6 2. certifiedmail written notice within the warranty period for all claims including emergencies to preserve formal coverage.236 - the emergency phone requirement is tied directly to liability: if the homeowner does not promptly call the builder is relieved of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages for that emergency.6 - the exclusions clause reinforces this by denying coverage for damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification423 making timeliness central to the homeowners ability to obtain repairs and reimbursement.  conclusion for an emergency defect under the builders limited warrantysuch as a burst pipethe buyer/owner is required to telephone the builder immediately at the listed emergency number only emergency reports are accepted by phone.6 delay in making this emergency call has serious consequences: failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages related to that emergency6 and any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are excluded from coverage.423 to maintain warranty rights the homeowner must both call immediately for emergencies and also submit a written certifiedmail claim within the applicable warranty period.",

Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.**” [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\nThus, for an emergency defect such as a burst pipe, the **required notification channel is a telephone call to the Builder’s emergency number**, not email, portal, or ordinary written notice. The emergency phone number is expressly listed in the notification section (e.g., “Emergency Number (208) 555‑2311” [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45]).\n\n### Q2 & Q6 – Time requirements/deadlines for using the emergency notification channel\n\nThe warranty does not give a specific number of hours or days for emergency notification; instead, it uses an **immediacy standard**:\n\n- For emergencies:  \n  > “If an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner **must telephone the Builder immediately.**” [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\nSo the time requirement is:\n\n- **Start point**: When an emergency exists or when delay will cause extra damage (e.g., when the burst pipe or similar emergency is discovered).  \n- **Deadline**: “Immediately” – i.e., without delay, as soon as reasonably possible.  \n- **Exception**: Only emergencies may be reported by phone; non‑emergency defects still require written certified‑mail notice within the applicable 60‑day or 1‑year warranty period [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\n### Q3 & Q7 – Contractual consequences/penalties for delay in using the required emergency channel\n\nThe warranty expressly states the consequence of failing to promptly use the emergency phone notification:\n\n- After explaining that emergencies must be reported by phone, it provides:  \n  > “**Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.**” [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\nThis is a clear contractual penalty:\n\n- If the Buyer/Owner does **not** promptly call the Builder about an emergency, the Builder is **relieved of all liability**:\n  - No obligation to replace the defective item  \n  - No obligation to repair it  \n  - No liability for “all other damages” related to that emergency [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\nSeparately, the exclusions section also states that the warranty does not cover:\n\n- “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.” [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\nSo delay in emergency notification can both:\n\n1. Relieve the Builder of all liability for that emergency event, and  \n2. Exclude from coverage any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice.\n\n### Q4 & Q8 – Effect of delay on warranty coverage, provider’s obligations, and customer’s rights\n\nThe combined effect of these provisions is:\n\n1. **On warranty coverage**  \n   - Claims must be made in writing within the applicable 60‑day or 1‑year period, or they are “not covered” [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].  \n   - For emergencies, failure to promptly call means the Builder is relieved of “all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages” [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].  \n   - The exclusions also remove coverage for “damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification” [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].  \n   Together, this means that **late or non‑compliant emergency notification can effectively eliminate warranty coverage for that emergency and any avoidable consequential damage.**\n\n2. **On the provider’s (Builder’s) obligations**  \n   - Normally, once a covered defect is properly reported in writing, the Builder must “repair or replace it at no charge” within 60 days (subject to delays for weather, labor, or materials) [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].  \n   - But if the emergency was not promptly reported by phone, the Builder is contractually **released from these obligations** for that emergency event [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\n3. **On the customer’s (Buyer/Owner’s) rights and remedies**  \n   - The Buyer/Owner’s right to have the emergency defect repaired or replaced under the warranty, and to claim related damages, depends on complying with the notification requirements.  \n   - If they delay and do not promptly call, they lose the right to enforce the Builder’s duty to repair/replace and to recover “all other damages” for that emergency [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].  \n   - Additionally, any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice are excluded from coverage [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\nIn short, **delay in using the required emergency phone channel can nullify the Builder’s obligations and the Buyer/Owner’s warranty remedies for that emergency and related avoidable damage.**\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The warranty distinguishes **ordinary defects** (certified‑mail written notice) from **emergency defects** (immediate telephone notice) [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n- The **time requirement (“immediately”) and the channel (telephone)** are tied together: only emergencies may be reported by phone, and they must be reported without delay [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n- The **consequence clause** (“relieves the Builder of all liability…”) is explicitly linked to **failure to promptly notify** of an emergency [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n- The **exclusion for damages avoidable by prompt notification** reinforces that delay directly reduces or eliminates coverage [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].\n\nTogether, these provisions show that the emergency notification requirement is not just procedural; it is a **condition precedent** to the Builder’s liability for emergency defects and related damages.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Builders Limited Warranty, if an emergency defect occurs (such as a burst pipe), the Buyer/Owner is required to **telephone the Builder immediately** at the listed emergency number; only emergency reports are accepted by phone [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45]. If the Buyer/Owner fails to promptly use this emergency phone channel, the warranty provides that the Builder is **relieved of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages** arising from that emergency, and any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are excluded from coverage [7], [16], [22], [32], [34], [44], [45].",
            "text_norm": " analysis  q1  q5  required notification channels for an emergency defect the builders limited warranty sets out two different notification methods depending on whether the issue is routine or an emergency: - standard nonemergency defects: the buyer/owner mustwrite a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the builder at the builders office address 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. this is a written certifiedmail notice requirement. - emergency defects e.g. burst pipe: the warranty then adds a special rule for emergencies:  if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage for instance a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately. only emergency reports will be taken by phone. 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. thus for an emergency defect such as a burst pipe the required notification channel is a telephone call to the builders emergency number not email portal or ordinary written notice. the emergency phone number is expressly listed in the notification section e.g. emergency number 208 5552311 7 16 22 32 34 44 45.  q2  q6  time requirements/deadlines for using the emergency notification channel the warranty does not give a specific number of hours or days for emergency notification instead it uses an immediacy standard: - for emergencies:  if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage for instance a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately. 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. so the time requirement is: - start point: when an emergency exists or when delay will cause extra damage e.g. when the burst pipe or similar emergency is discovered. - deadline: immediately  i.e. without delay as soon as reasonably possible. - exception: only emergencies may be reported by phone nonemergency defects still require written certifiedmail notice within the applicable 60day or 1year warranty period 7 16 22 32 34 44 45.  q3  q7  contractual consequences/penalties for delay in using the required emergency channel the warranty expressly states the consequence of failing to promptly use the emergency phone notification: - after explaining that emergencies must be reported by phone it provides:  failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages. 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. this is a clear contractual penalty: - if the buyer/owner does not promptly call the builder about an emergency the builder is relieved of all liability: - no obligation to replace the defective item - no obligation to repair it - no liability for all other damages related to that emergency 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. separately the exclusions section also states that the warranty does not cover: - damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder. 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. so delay in emergency notification can both: 1. relieve the builder of all liability for that emergency event and 2. exclude from coverage any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice.  q4  q8  effect of delay on warranty coverage providers obligations and customers rights the combined effect of these provisions is: 1. on warranty coverage - claims must be made in writing within the applicable 60day or 1year period or they are not covered 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. - for emergencies failure to promptly call means the builder is relieved of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. - the exclusions also remove coverage for damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. together this means that late or noncompliant emergency notification can effectively eliminate warranty coverage for that emergency and any avoidable consequential damage. 2. on the providers builders obligations - normally once a covered defect is properly reported in writing the builder must repair or replace it at no charge within 60 days subject to delays for weather labor or materials 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. - but if the emergency was not promptly reported by phone the builder is contractually released from these obligations for that emergency event 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. 3. on the customers buyer/owners rights and remedies - the buyer/owners right to have the emergency defect repaired or replaced under the warranty and to claim related damages depends on complying with the notification requirements. - if they delay and do not promptly call they lose the right to enforce the builders duty to repair/replace and to recover all other damages for that emergency 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. - additionally any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice are excluded from coverage 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. in short delay in using the required emergency phone channel can nullify the builders obligations and the buyer/owners warranty remedies for that emergency and related avoidable damage.  key connections - the warranty distinguishes ordinary defects certifiedmail written notice from emergency defects immediate telephone notice 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. - the time requirement immediately and the channel telephone are tied together: only emergencies may be reported by phone and they must be reported without delay 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. - the consequence clause relieves the builder of all liability is explicitly linked to failure to promptly notify of an emergency 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. - the exclusion for damages avoidable by prompt notification reinforces that delay directly reduces or eliminates coverage 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. together these provisions show that the emergency notification requirement is not just procedural it is a condition precedent to the builders liability for emergency defects and related damages.  conclusion under the builders limited warranty if an emergency defect occurs such as a burst pipe the buyer/owner is required to telephone the builder immediately at the listed emergency number only emergency reports are accepted by phone 7 16 22 32 34 44 45. if the buyer/owner fails to promptly use this emergency phone channel the warranty provides that the builder is relieved of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages arising from that emergency and any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are excluded from coverage 7 16 22 32 34 44 45.",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1. How are “confirmed reservations” defined and identified at termination or sale?\n\nThe Property Management Agreement mentions “confirmed reservations” only in the TERM clause:\n\n> “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe agreement does **not** provide:\n- an explicit definition of “confirmed reservations,” nor  \n- a procedure for how they are identified at the time of termination or sale.\n\nHowever, the same TERM clause clarifies that:\n\n> “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nFrom this, the best grounded reading is:\n- “Confirmed reservations” are those **existing rental agreements** that the Agent has already made on the Owner’s behalf as of the date of termination or sale. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe agreement does not spell out how, administratively, they are “identified” (e.g., by a list, booking system, or written schedule). That would have to be inferred as whatever reservations the Agent has already booked and documented as rental agreements on the Owner’s behalf.\n\n### Q2 & Q3. What happens to those reservations (honored, canceled, transferred) and who is responsible for fulfilling them?\n\nThe TERM clause directly addresses what happens:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nFrom this:\n\n1. **Are they honored, canceled, or transferred?**  \n   - They are **not canceled** by termination of the management agreement; the agreement explicitly says termination “does not invalidate” them. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n   - They must be **honored** by the Owner: “the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n   - The agreement does **not** use the word “transferred” or describe any transfer mechanism (e.g., to a new manager). Any transfer to a new management company would be outside the four corners of this document.\n\n2. **Who is responsible for fulfilling them?**  \n   - The clause places the obligation squarely on the **Owner**: “Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n   - Additionally, upon termination:  \n     > “Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n\n   This means:\n   - Even after the management agreement ends, the Owner must ensure that obligations arising from those reservations (and other obligations incurred by the Agent) are completed—either directly or by arranging for someone else to complete them. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe Agent’s ongoing role after termination is not described; the contract only preserves the validity of the rental agreements and shifts the continuing responsibility to the Owner.\n\n### Q4. How are obligations/expenses related to confirmed reservations allocated if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold?\n\nThe TERM clause again governs:\n\n> “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nCombined with the requirement to honor confirmed reservations:\n\n> “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nAllocation is therefore:\n\n- **To the Owner**:\n  - Responsibility for all obligations and expenses that the Agent incurred under the agreement, which would include obligations tied to existing rental agreements/confirmed reservations (e.g., housekeeping, maintenance scheduled for those stays, advertising already committed, etc.). [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n  - Responsibility to honor the stays themselves (provide occupancy as booked). [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\n- **To the Agent**:\n  - No continuing obligations are stated after termination; the Agent’s duties are defined under “RESPONSIBILITIES OF AGENT” during the term, but the TERM clause does not impose post‑termination performance on the Agent. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe agreement does not separately allocate specific categories of revenue (e.g., rent already collected vs. future rent) in the termination context; it only states that the Owner remains responsible for obligations/expenses incurred and must honor the reservations.\n\n### Q5. Are there differences between termination and sale, and how are they described?\n\nThe key sentence treats termination and sale identically:\n\n> “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThere is **no distinction** in the text between:\n- termination of the management agreement, and  \n- sale of the property,\n\nwith respect to confirmed reservations. In both scenarios:\n- The existing rental agreements remain valid. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n- The Owner must honor all confirmed reservations. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe agreement does not address:\n- whether a new owner (after sale) must assume these obligations, or  \n- how the obligation is enforced if the “Owner” changes.\n\nIt simply states that “Owner” (as defined in the agreement) shall honor them, without further differentiation between pre‑sale and post‑sale ownership.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are not expressly defined, but are logically the “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf” that remain valid despite termination. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n- Termination or sale does **not** cancel these reservations; instead, the Owner must honor them and remains responsible for obligations and expenses the Agent incurred in connection with them. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n- The contract treats termination of the management agreement and sale of the property the same way regarding confirmed reservations; no different rules or allocations are described for those two events. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, any existing rental agreements that the Agent has already made on the Owner’s behalf (“confirmed reservations”) remain valid and must be honored. Termination “does not invalidate” those rental agreements, and in either a termination or a sale, the Owner is obligated to honor all confirmed reservations and to remain responsible for, or cause completion of, all obligations and expenses the Agent incurred under the agreement, including those tied to those reservations.

the clause places the obligation squarely on the owner: owner shall honor all confirmed reservations. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 - additionally upon termination:  owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 this means: - even after the management agreement ends the owner must ensure that obligations arising from those reservations and other obligations incurred by the agent are completedeither directly or by arranging for someone else to complete them. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 the agents ongoing role after termination is not described the contract only preserves the validity of the rental agreements and shifts the continuing responsibility to the owner.  q4. how are obligations/expenses related to confirmed reservations allocated if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold the term clause again governs:  upon termination owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 combined with the requirement to honor confirmed reservations:  in the event this agreement is terminated or the property is sold the owner shall honor all confirmed reservations. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 allocation is therefore: - to the owner: - responsibility for all obligations and expenses that the agent incurred under the agreement which would include obligations tied to existing rental agreements/confirmed reservations e.g. housekeeping maintenance scheduled for those stays advertising already committed etc.. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 - responsibility to honor the stays themselves provide occupancy as booked. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 - to the agent: - no continuing obligations are stated after termination the agents duties are defined under responsibilities of agent during the term but the term clause does not impose posttermination performance on the agent. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 the agreement does not separately allocate specific categories of revenue e.g. rent already collected vs. future rent in the termination context it only states that the owner remains responsible for obligations/expenses incurred and must honor the reservations.  q5. are there differences between termination and sale and how are they described the key sentence treats termination and sale identically:  in the event this agreement is terminated or the property is sold the owner shall honor all confirmed reservations. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 there is no distinction in the text between: - termination of the management agreement and - sale of the property with respect to confirmed reservations. in both scenarios: - the existing rental agreements remain valid. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 - the owner must honor all confirmed reservations. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 the agreement does not address: - whether a new owner after sale must assume these obligations or - how the obligation is enforced if the owner changes. it simply states that owner as defined in the agreement shall honor them without further differentiation between presale and postsale ownership.  key connections - confirmed reservations are not expressly defined but are logically the existing rental agreements made by agent on owners behalf that remain valid despite termination. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 - termination or sale does not cancel these reservations instead the owner must honor them and remains responsible for obligations and expenses the agent incurred in connection with them. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70 - the contract treats termination of the management agreement and sale of the property the same way regarding confirmed reservations no different rules or allocations are described for those two events. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70  conclusion under the property management agreement if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold any existing rental agreements that the agent has already made on the owners behalf confirmed reservations remain valid and must be honored. termination does not invalidate those rental agreements and in either a termination or a sale the owner is obligated to honor all confirmed reservations and to remain responsible for or cause completion of all obligations and expenses the agent incurred under the agreement including those tied to those reservations. 5 19 29 36 40 49 57 59 70",

How are “confirmed reservations” defined and identified at termination or sale?\n\nThe Property Management Agreement mentions “confirmed reservations” only in the TERM clause:\n\n> “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe agreement does **not** provide:\n- an explicit definition of “confirmed reservations,” nor  \n- a procedure for how they are identified at the time of termination or sale.\n\nHowever, the same TERM clause clarifies that:\n\n> “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nFrom this, the best grounded reading is:\n- “Confirmed reservations” are those **existing rental agreements** that the Agent has already made on the Owner’s behalf as of the date of termination or sale. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe agreement does not spell out how, administratively, they are “identified” (e.g., by a list, booking system, or written schedule). That would have to be inferred as whatever reservations the Agent has already booked and documented as rental agreements on the Owner’s behalf.\n\n### Q2 & Q3. What happens to those reservations (honored, canceled, transferred) and who is responsible for fulfilling them?\n\nThe TERM clause directly addresses what happens:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nFrom this:\n\n1. **Are they honored, canceled, or transferred?**  \n   - They are **not canceled** by termination of the management agreement; the agreement explicitly says termination “does not invalidate” them. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n   - They must be **honored** by the Owner: “the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n   - The agreement does **not** use the word “transferred” or describe any transfer mechanism (e.g., to a new manager). Any transfer to a new management company would be outside the four corners of this document.\n\n2. **Who is responsible for fulfilling them?**  \n   - The clause places the obligation squarely on the **Owner**: “Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n   - Additionally, upon termination:  \n     > “Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n\n   This means:\n   - Even after the management agreement ends, the Owner must ensure that obligations arising from those reservations (and other obligations incurred by the Agent) are completed—either directly or by arranging for someone else to complete them. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe Agent’s ongoing role after termination is not described; the contract only preserves the validity of the rental agreements and shifts the continuing responsibility to the Owner.\n\n### Q4. How are obligations/expenses related to confirmed reservations allocated if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold?\n\nThe TERM clause again governs:\n\n> “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nCombined with the requirement to honor confirmed reservations:\n\n> “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nAllocation is therefore:\n\n- **To the Owner**:\n  - Responsibility for all obligations and expenses that the Agent incurred under the agreement, which would include obligations tied to existing rental agreements/confirmed reservations (e.g., housekeeping, maintenance scheduled for those stays, advertising already committed, etc.). [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n  - Responsibility to honor the stays themselves (provide occupancy as booked). [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\n- **To the Agent**:\n  - No continuing obligations are stated after termination; the Agent’s duties are defined under “RESPONSIBILITIES OF AGENT” during the term, but the TERM clause does not impose post‑termination performance on the Agent. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe agreement does not separately allocate specific categories of revenue (e.g., rent already collected vs. future rent) in the termination context; it only states that the Owner remains responsible for obligations/expenses incurred and must honor the reservations.\n\n### Q5. Are there differences between termination and sale, and how are they described?\n\nThe key sentence treats termination and sale identically:\n\n> “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThere is **no distinction** in the text between:\n- termination of the management agreement, and  \n- sale of the property,\n\nwith respect to confirmed reservations. In both scenarios:\n- The existing rental agreements remain valid. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]  \n- The Owner must honor all confirmed reservations. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\nThe agreement does not address:\n- whether a new owner (after sale) must assume these obligations, or  \n- how the obligation is enforced if the “Owner” changes.\n\nIt simply states that “Owner” (as defined in the agreement) shall honor them, without further differentiation between pre‑sale and post‑sale ownership.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are not expressly defined, but are logically the “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf” that remain valid despite termination. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n- Termination or sale does **not** cancel these reservations; instead, the Owner must honor them and remains responsible for obligations and expenses the Agent incurred in connection with them. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n- The contract treats termination of the management agreement and sale of the property the same way regarding confirmed reservations; no different rules or allocations are described for those two events. [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [57], [59], [70]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, any existing rental agreements that the Agent has already made on the Owner’s behalf (“confirmed reservations”) remain valid and must be honored. Termination “does not invalidate” those rental agreements, and in either a termination or a sale, the Owner is obligated to honor all confirmed reservations and to remain responsible for, or cause completion of, all obligations and expenses the Agent incurred under the agreement, including those tied to those reservations.

Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent. **In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.**” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]\n\nThe agreement does **not** provide an explicit definition section for “confirmed reservations,” nor does it spell out a special identification procedure at the time of termination or sale. There is no clause that:\n\n- Defines “confirmed reservation” (e.g., paid deposit, signed rental contract, etc.), or  \n- Describes a process for listing or certifying which reservations are “confirmed” as of the termination/sale date.\n\nHowever, the same paragraph clarifies that “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf” remain valid despite termination [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]. From this, the reasonable reading is:\n\n- A “confirmed reservation” is an **existing rental agreement** that the Agent has already entered into on the Owner’s behalf before termination or sale.  \n- These would be identifiable in practice through the Agent’s booking records and the rental agreements already issued to guests, but the contract itself does not prescribe a specific identification mechanism.\n\nSo, legally within this document, “confirmed reservations” are treated as the set of already-existing rental agreements in place at the time of termination or sale, even though the term is not formally defined beyond that context.\n\n### Q2: What happens to those confirmed reservations (how are they allocated/handled)?\n\nThe operative language is:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]  \n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]\n\nFrom these clauses:\n\n1. **Reservations remain valid:**  \n   Termination of the management agreement does not cancel or invalidate any existing rental agreements with guests [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\n2. **Owner’s continuing responsibility:**  \n   After termination, the Owner must:\n   - Remain responsible for, or ensure completion of, all obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent under the agreement [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].  \n   - Specifically, **honor all confirmed reservations** whether the agreement is merely terminated or the property is sold [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\n3. **Effect of a sale of the property:**  \n   The same obligation applies “in the event … the property is sold” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]. The contract does not detail how this is implemented between seller and buyer, but contractually:\n   - As between Owner and Agent, the Owner remains bound to ensure that guests with confirmed reservations can occupy the property as booked.  \n   - Practically, this usually means the seller must either:\n     - Contractually bind the buyer to honor those reservations, or  \n     - Personally fulfill or compensate for those obligations; but the document itself only states the Owner “shall honor” them, without specifying internal allocation between old and new owner.\n\n4. **No reallocation of income/fees specified:**  \n   The agreement does not contain a clause reallocating rental income or management fees for stays occurring after termination or sale. It only addresses:\n   - The Agent’s right to fees during the term [3], [4], [6], [11], [13], [22], [24], [31], [32], [35], [38], [39], [41], [42], [45], [46], [53], [55], [56], [61], [62], [65], [66], [68], [69].  \n   - The Owner’s obligation to honor reservations and complete obligations incurred under the agreement [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\nThus, the “allocation” question is answered at a high level: the **obligation** to perform those reservations is allocated to the Owner (even after termination or sale), and the reservations themselves remain in force; the contract does not further allocate financial flows for post-termination stays.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The phrase “confirmed reservations” appears only in the context of termination or sale and is directly tied to “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].  \n- The same paragraph simultaneously:\n  - Preserves the validity of those rental agreements despite termination, and  \n  - Imposes a continuing duty on the Owner to honor them and complete related obligations/expenses [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\nThese two elements together answer both what “confirmed reservations” functionally are (existing rental agreements) and what happens to them (they survive termination/sale and must be honored by the Owner).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, “confirmed reservations” are, in effect, the existing rental agreements that the Agent has already made on the Owner’s behalf as of the time the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]. The agreement does not give a more technical definition or a special identification procedure.\n\nWhen the agreement ends or the property is sold:\n\n- Those existing rental agreements are **not invalidated** by the termination of the management agreement [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].  \n- The Owner remains responsible to complete all obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement and **must honor all confirmed reservations**, even after termination or sale [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\nThe contract does not further specify how income or performance responsibilities are divided between a selling owner and a buyer; it simply places the duty, as between Owner and Agent, on the Owner to ensure that all confirmed reservations are honored.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1: How are “confirmed reservations” defined and identified at termination or sale?\n\nThe Property Management Agreement states:\n\n> “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf. Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent. **In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.**” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]\n\nThe agreement does **not** provide an explicit definition section for “confirmed reservations,” nor does it spell out a special identification procedure at the time of termination or sale. There is no clause that:\n\n- Defines “confirmed reservation” (e.g., paid deposit, signed rental contract, etc.), or  \n- Describes a process for listing or certifying which reservations are “confirmed” as of the termination/sale date.\n\nHowever, the same paragraph clarifies that “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf” remain valid despite termination [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]. From this, the reasonable reading is:\n\n- A “confirmed reservation” is an **existing rental agreement** that the Agent has already entered into on the Owner’s behalf before termination or sale.  \n- These would be identifiable in practice through the Agent’s booking records and the rental agreements already issued to guests, but the contract itself does not prescribe a specific identification mechanism.\n\nSo, legally within this document, “confirmed reservations” are treated as the set of already-existing rental agreements in place at the time of termination or sale, even though the term is not formally defined beyond that context.\n\n### Q2: What happens to those confirmed reservations (how are they allocated/handled)?\n\nThe operative language is:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]  \n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]\n\nFrom these clauses:\n\n1. **Reservations remain valid:**  \n   Termination of the management agreement does not cancel or invalidate any existing rental agreements with guests [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\n2. **Owner’s continuing responsibility:**  \n   After termination, the Owner must:\n   - Remain responsible for, or ensure completion of, all obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent under the agreement [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].  \n   - Specifically, **honor all confirmed reservations** whether the agreement is merely terminated or the property is sold [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\n3. **Effect of a sale of the property:**  \n   The same obligation applies “in the event … the property is sold” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]. The contract does not detail how this is implemented between seller and buyer, but contractually:\n   - As between Owner and Agent, the Owner remains bound to ensure that guests with confirmed reservations can occupy the property as booked.  \n   - Practically, this usually means the seller must either:\n     - Contractually bind the buyer to honor those reservations, or  \n     - Personally fulfill or compensate for those obligations; but the document itself only states the Owner “shall honor” them, without specifying internal allocation between old and new owner.\n\n4. **No reallocation of income/fees specified:**  \n   The agreement does not contain a clause reallocating rental income or management fees for stays occurring after termination or sale. It only addresses:\n   - The Agent’s right to fees during the term [3], [4], [6], [11], [13], [22], [24], [31], [32], [35], [38], [39], [41], [42], [45], [46], [53], [55], [56], [61], [62], [65], [66], [68], [69].  \n   - The Owner’s obligation to honor reservations and complete obligations incurred under the agreement [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\nThus, the “allocation” question is answered at a high level: the **obligation** to perform those reservations is allocated to the Owner (even after termination or sale), and the reservations themselves remain in force; the contract does not further allocate financial flows for post-termination stays.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The phrase “confirmed reservations” appears only in the context of termination or sale and is directly tied to “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf” [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].  \n- The same paragraph simultaneously:\n  - Preserves the validity of those rental agreements despite termination, and  \n  - Imposes a continuing duty on the Owner to honor them and complete related obligations/expenses [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\nThese two elements together answer both what “confirmed reservations” functionally are (existing rental agreements) and what happens to them (they survive termination/sale and must be honored by the Owner).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, “confirmed reservations” are, in effect, the existing rental agreements that the Agent has already made on the Owner’s behalf as of the time the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70]. The agreement does not give a more technical definition or a special identification procedure.\n\nWhen the agreement ends or the property is sold:\n\n- Those existing rental agreements are **not invalidated** by the termination of the management agreement [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].  \n- The Owner remains responsible to complete all obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement and **must honor all confirmed reservations**, even after termination or sale [5], [19], [29], [36], [40], [49], [52], [54], [57], [59], [64], [67], [70].\n\nThe contract does not further specify how income or performance responsibilities are divided between a selling owner and a buyer; it simply places the duty, as between Owner and Agent, on the Owner to ensure that all confirmed reservations are honored.",

One (1) year warranty period for major components (floors, ceilings, walls, internal structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical, roof) [12].  \n2. Sixty (60) days warranty period for certain items (doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, plumbing fixtures, cabinet work) [12].  \n3. Warranty term begins on date of final settlement or first occupancy, whichever comes first [3][4].  \n4. Warranty terminates one (1) year or sixty (60) days after commencement, as applicable [3][4].  \n5. Claims must be made in writing within the applicable one (1) year or sixty (60) day period; claims not made within that period are not covered [3][4].  \n6. Builder will repair or replace covered defects within sixty (60) days of receiving written notice (longer if delayed by weather, labor, or materials) [1][3][4].  \n7. Arbitration demand must be made “not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross‑claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above” [1].  \n8. Parties agree, “to the maximum extent practicable,” to conclude an arbitration within 180 days of filing the dispute with the administrator [9][10][11].  \n9. Any implied warranties that cannot be disclaimed are deemed limited to the warranty period (term) set forth (i.e., the one‑year/60‑day periods) [10][11].\n\n**Purchase Contract (Contoso Lifts)**  \n10. Contractor warrants labor for 90 days [2][6].  \n11. Customer may cancel within 3 business days for a full refund; after that, the deposit is forfeited [2][6].\n\n**Property Management Agreement**  \n12. Initial term of the agreement is twelve months beginning on 2010‑06‑15 [5].  \n13. Agreement is automatically renewed for successive one‑year terms thereafter [5].  \n14. Either party may terminate the agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice [5].  \n15. Owner must provide Agent written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale [5].  \n16. Short‑term/vacation rentals are defined as reservations of less than 180 days [5][7][8].  \n17. Long‑term leases are defined as leases of more than 180 days [5][7][8].\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**  \n18. In the event of a change in the service contract, the owner must file a copy of any changes or a new contract with the municipality and County within ten (10) business days from the date of change [14].\n\n**Invoice**  \nNo explicit day‑based time windows beyond the “DATE” of the invoice and a due‑on‑signing note, which is event‑based rather than a fixed number of days [15].\n\n---\n\n### Q2 – Focus only on explicit day-based timeframes\n\nFiltering to explicit day‑based windows (days, business days, months, years):\n\n- **1 year**:  \n  - Major components warranty duration [12].  \n  - Overall warranty term for those items, starting at settlement/occupancy [3][4].  \n  - Limitation period for claims on those items [3][4].  \n  - Initial term of property management agreement [5].  \n  - Automatic renewal terms of property management agreement [5].  \n  - Implied warranties limited to the same warranty period [10][11].\n\n- **60 days**:  \n  - Warranty duration for specified minor items (doors, windows, etc.) [12].  \n  - Termination of coverage for those items after 60 days from commencement [3][4].  \n  - Claims on those items must be made within 60 days [3][4].  \n  - Builder’s obligation to complete repairs within 60 days of written notice (subject to delays) [1][3][4].  \n  - Arbitration demand window: not more than 60 days after service of complaint/pleading [1].  \n  - Termination notice period for property management agreement (60 days written notice) [5].\n\n- **180 days**:  \n  - Target to conclude arbitration within 180 days of filing the dispute [9][10][11].  \n  - Threshold distinguishing short‑term (<180 days) vs. long‑term (>180 days) rentals/leases [5][7][8].\n\n- **90 days**:  \n  - Labor warranty period under the purchase contract [2][6].\n\n- **3 business days**:  \n  - Customer’s right‑to‑cancel window for full refund; after that, deposit is forfeited [2][6].\n\n- **5 business days**:  \n  - Owner must notify Agent within five (5) business days of entering a listing agreement to sell the property [5].\n\n- **10 business days**:  \n  - Owner must file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and County within ten (10) business days of the change [14].\n\n- **12 months / one year terms**:  \n  - Property management agreement initial and renewal terms (twelve months / one year) [5].\n\n---\n\n### Q3 – How do these time windows differ in length, conditions, or usage?\n\n**Length differences**\n\n- Very short windows:  \n  - 3 business days (cancellation right) [2][6].  \n  - 5 business days (owner’s listing‑notice obligation) [5].  \n  - 10 business days (filing revised holding‑tank contract) [14].\n\n- Short to medium windows:  \n  - 60 days (minor‑item warranty, repair completion target, arbitration demand limit, termination notice) [1][3][4][5].  \n  - 90 days (labor warranty) [2][6].  \n  - 180 days (arbitration completion target;

arbitrator may impose sanctions for failure to proceed within the times established [9][10][11].  \n  - Termination of the property management agreement requires 60 days written notice; until then, the agreement remains in effect and existing reservations must be honored [5].\n\n**Usage contexts**\n\n- **Warranty / defect coverage**: 1‑year, 60‑day, and 90‑day windows [2][3][4][6][12].  \n- **Consumer protection / cancellation**: 3 business days [2][6].  \n- **Contract term and termination**: 12‑month terms and 60‑day termination notice [5].  \n- **Classification of rental type**: <180 days vs >180 days [5][7][8].  \n- **Dispute resolution**: 60‑day arbitration demand window and 180‑day arbitration completion target [1][9][10][11].  \n- **Regulatory / administrative compliance**: 5‑business‑day listing notice [5];

the 3‑day window runs from that point [2][6].  \n  - Use: Consumer protection window allowing cancellation for full refund; after it expires, deposit is forfeited if customer cancels [2][6].\n\n- **12‑month / one‑year property management term**  \n  - Length: 12 months initial term; successive one‑year renewals [5].  \n  - Trigger: Begins on 2010‑06‑15 [5].  \n  - Use: Defines the duration of the agency relationship and renewal cycle [5].\n\n- **60‑day termination notice (property management)**  \n  - Length: 60 days [5].  \n  - Trigger: Either party giving written notice of termination [5].  \n  - Use: Notice period before the agreement ends;

starts at settlement/occupancy; limits coverage and claim period [3][4][12].  \n- 60 days – minor items warranty; same start; limits coverage and claim period [3][4][12].  \n- 60 days – repair completion; starts on written notice; defines performance deadline [1][3][4].  \n- 60 days – arbitration demand; starts on service of complaint/pleading; defines when arbitration can be compelled [1].  \n- 180 days – arbitration completion; starts on filing dispute; target to finish arbitration, with possible sanctions [9][10][11].  \n- 90 days – labor warranty; starts at completion of work; defines labor coverage period [2][6].  \n- 3 business days – cancellation right; starts at contract effectiveness; allows full refund if exercised; after that, deposit forfeited [2][6].  \n- 12 months / 1 year – property management term and renewals; starts on specified date; defines agency duration [5].  \n- 60 days – termination notice; starts when notice given; defines lead time before agreement ends [5].  \n- <180 / >180 days – classification threshold; based on reservation/lease length; determines commission rate [5][7][8].  \n- 5 business days – owner listing notice; starts when listing agreement is signed; ensures timely notice to Agent [5].  \n- 10 business days – filing revised holding‑tank contract; starts on date of change; ensures regulatory compliance [14].  \n- Warranty period as cap on implied warranties – same 1‑year/60‑day term; applies if implied warranties are found; limits their duration [10][11].\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Warranty vs. performance vs. dispute windows**:  \n  - Builder’s 1‑year and 60‑day warranties define how long defects are covered [12], while a separate 60‑day window governs how quickly repairs must be completed after notice [1][3][4].  \n  - Dispute‑resolution windows (60‑day arbitration demand, 180‑day completion) sit on top of those warranty periods, governing how and when disputes are resolved rather than what is covered [1][9][10][11].\n\n- **Consumer protection vs. contractor protection**:  \n  - The 3‑business‑day cancellation window protects the customer (full refund) [2][6], while the 90‑day labor warranty and forfeiture of deposit after 3 days protect the contractor by limiting long‑term exposure [2][6].\n\n- **Operational vs. regulatory timeframes**:  \n  - Operational/contractual windows: property management term (12 months), 60‑day termination notice, 5‑business‑day listing notice, 180‑day rental threshold [5][7][8].  \n  - Regulatory/administrative windows: 10‑business‑day filing of holding‑tank contract changes [14]; reporting obligations in the holding‑tank contract are tied to service dates [14].\n\n- **Classification thresholds**:  \n  - The 180‑day threshold is used both as a classification boundary (short‑ vs long‑term rentals) [5][7][8] and as a target duration for arbitration proceedings [9][10][11], but in different contexts (fee structure vs. dispute resolution).\n\n- **Notice vs. action windows**:  \n  - Some windows govern notice (5‑day listing notice, 60‑day termination notice, 60‑day arbitration demand) [1][5].  \n  - Others govern action/performance (60‑day repair completion, 180‑day arbitration completion, 10‑day filing of contract changes) [1][9][10][11][14].  \n  - Others govern coverage/rights (1‑year/60‑day warranties, 90‑day labor warranty, 3‑day cancellation) [2][3][4][6][12].\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the corpus, the explicit day‑based “time windows” are:\n\n- 1‑year and 60‑day warranty periods (builder) with associated claim deadlines and implied‑warranty caps [3][4][10][11][12].  \n- A 60‑day window for completing repairs after notice [1][3][4].  \n- A 60‑day window to demand arbitration after service of a complaint, and a 180‑day target to conclude arbitration after filing [1][9][10][11].  \n- A 90‑day labor warranty (purchase contract) [2][6].  \n- A 3‑business‑day cancellation window for full refund, after which the deposit is forfeited [2][6].  \n- A 12‑month initial term and successive one‑year renewals for the property management agreement, with a 60‑day written termination notice requirement [5].  \n- A 180‑day threshold distinguishing short‑term (<180 days) from long‑term (>180 days) rentals/leases, which drives commission rates [5][7][8].  \n- A 5‑business‑day window for the owner to notify the Agent of a listing agreement [5].  \n- A 10‑business‑day window to file changes to the holding‑tank service contract with local authorities [14].\n\nThese windows differ in length (from 3 business days to 1 year), in what triggers them (contract signing, occupancy, service of legal papers, filing of disputes, entering a listing agreement, changing a service contract), and in their usage (defining warranty coverage, consumer cancellation rights, contract term and termination, rental classification, dispute resolution timelines, and regulatory compliance). Together, they constitute the set of explicit day‑based timeframes that define or describe “time windows” across the documents.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\nBelow, “time windows” means explicit, day-based timeframes (e.g., X days, Y business days, Z months/years) that define when something can or must happen.\n\n---\n\n### Q1 – Identify all “time windows” across the set\n\nAcross all documents, the following explicit day‑based timeframes appear:\n\n**Builders Limited Warranty**  \n1. One (1) year warranty period for major components (floors, ceilings, walls, internal structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical, roof) [12].  \n2. Sixty (60) days warranty period for certain items (doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, plumbing fixtures, cabinet work) [12].  \n3. Warranty term begins on date of final settlement or first occupancy, whichever comes first [3][4].  \n4. Warranty terminates one (1) year or sixty (60) days after commencement, as applicable [3][4].  \n5. Claims must be made in writing within the applicable one (1) year or sixty (60) day period; claims not made within that period are not covered [3][4].  \n6. Builder will repair or replace covered defects within sixty (60) days of receiving written notice (longer if delayed by weather, labor, or materials) [1][3][4].  \n7. Arbitration demand must be made “not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross‑claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above” [1].  \n8. Parties agree, “to the maximum extent practicable,” to conclude an arbitration within 180 days of filing the dispute with the administrator [9][10][11].  \n9. Any implied warranties that cannot be disclaimed are deemed limited to the warranty period (term) set forth (i.e., the one‑year/60‑day periods) [10][11].\n\n**Purchase Contract (Contoso Lifts)**  \n10. Contractor warrants labor for 90 days [2][6].  \n11. Customer may cancel within 3 business days for a full refund; after that, the deposit is forfeited [2][6].\n\n**Property Management Agreement**  \n12. Initial term of the agreement is twelve months beginning on 2010‑06‑15 [5].  \n13. Agreement is automatically renewed for successive one‑year terms thereafter [5].  \n14. Either party may terminate the agreement upon sixty (60) days written notice [5].  \n15. Owner must provide Agent written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale [5].  \n16. Short‑term/vacation rentals are defined as reservations of less than 180 days [5][7][8].  \n17. Long‑term leases are defined as leases of more than 180 days [5][7][8].\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**  \n18. In the event of a change in the service contract, the owner must file a copy of any changes or a new contract with the municipality and County within ten (10) business days from the date of change [14].\n\n**Invoice**  \nNo explicit day‑based time windows beyond the “DATE” of the invoice and a due‑on‑signing note, which is event‑based rather than a fixed number of days [15].\n\n---\n\n### Q2 – Focus only on explicit day-based timeframes\n\nFiltering to explicit day‑based windows (days, business days, months, years):\n\n- **1 year**:  \n  - Major components warranty duration [12].  \n  - Overall warranty term for those items, starting at settlement/occupancy [3][4].  \n  - Limitation period for claims on those items [3][4].  \n  - Initial term of property management agreement [5].  \n  - Automatic renewal terms of property management agreement [5].  \n  - Implied warranties limited to the same warranty period [10][11].\n\n- **60 days**:  \n  - Warranty duration for specified minor items (doors, windows, etc.) [12].  \n  - Termination of coverage for those items after 60 days from commencement [3][4].  \n  - Claims on those items must be made within 60 days [3][4].  \n  - Builder’s obligation to complete repairs within 60 days of written notice (subject to delays) [1][3][4].  \n  - Arbitration demand window: not more than 60 days after service of complaint/pleading [1].  \n  - Termination notice period for property management agreement (60 days written notice) [5].\n\n- **180 days**:  \n  - Target to conclude arbitration within 180 days of filing the dispute [9][10][11].  \n  - Threshold distinguishing short‑term (<180 days) vs. long‑term (>180 days) rentals/leases [5][7][8].\n\n- **90 days**:  \n  - Labor warranty period under the purchase contract [2][6].\n\n- **3 business days**:  \n  - Customer’s right‑to‑cancel window for full refund; after that, deposit is forfeited [2][6].\n\n- **5 business days**:  \n  - Owner must notify Agent within five (5) business days of entering a listing agreement to sell the property [5].\n\n- **10 business days**:  \n  - Owner must file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and County within ten (10) business days of the change [14].\n\n- **12 months / one year terms**:  \n  - Property management agreement initial and renewal terms (twelve months / one year) [5].\n\n---\n\n### Q3 – How do these time windows differ in length, conditions, or usage?\n\n**Length differences**\n\n- Very short windows:  \n  - 3 business days (cancellation right) [2][6].  \n  - 5 business days (owner’s listing‑notice obligation) [5].  \n  - 10 business days (filing revised holding‑tank contract) [14].\n\n- Short to medium windows:  \n  - 60 days (minor‑item warranty, repair completion target, arbitration demand limit, termination notice) [1][3][4][5].  \n  - 90 days (labor warranty) [2][6].  \n  - 180 days (arbitration completion target; short‑ vs long‑term rental threshold) [5][7][8][9][10][11].\n\n- Long windows:  \n  - 12 months / one (1) year (major‑component warranty; property management term and renewals) [5][12].\n\n**Conditions / triggers**\n\n- **Start triggers**:\n  - Warranty periods start at final settlement or first occupancy, whichever comes first [3][4].  \n  - Labor warranty presumably starts upon completion (implied by “warrants labor for 90 days” in the contract context) [2][6].  \n  - Property management term starts on a specific date (2010‑06‑15) [5].  \n  - Arbitration 60‑day window starts upon service of complaint/pleading [1].  \n  - 180‑day arbitration completion window starts upon filing the dispute with the administrator [9][10][11].  \n  - 5‑business‑day notice window starts when the owner enters a listing agreement [5].  \n  - 10‑business‑day filing window starts on the date of change to the holding‑tank service contract [14].  \n  - 3‑business‑day cancellation window starts at contract signing (effective upon mutual signature and initial payment) [2][6].\n\n- **End conditions / consequences**:\n  - After 1 year or 60 days (as applicable), warranty coverage ends and claims not made in writing within that period are not covered [3][4].  \n  - After 3 business days, cancellation is still possible but deposit is forfeited (no full refund) [2][6].  \n  - Failure to notify within 5 business days or file within 10 business days would be a breach of those obligations (though specific penalties are not spelled out) [5][14].  \n  - Failure to demand arbitration within 60 days of service may waive the right to compel arbitration under that clause [1].  \n  - Arbitration is intended to be concluded within 180 days; arbitrator may impose sanctions for failure to proceed within the times established [9][10][11].  \n  - Termination of the property management agreement requires 60 days written notice; until then, the agreement remains in effect and existing reservations must be honored [5].\n\n**Usage contexts**\n\n- **Warranty / defect coverage**: 1‑year, 60‑day, and 90‑day windows [2][3][4][6][12].  \n- **Consumer protection / cancellation**: 3 business days [2][6].  \n- **Contract term and termination**: 12‑month terms and 60‑day termination notice [5].  \n- **Classification of rental type**: <180 days vs >180 days [5][7][8].  \n- **Dispute resolution**: 60‑day arbitration demand window and 180‑day arbitration completion target [1][9][10][11].  \n- **Regulatory / administrative compliance**: 5‑business‑day listing notice [5]; 10‑business‑day filing of revised holding‑tank contract [14].  \n- **Performance of repairs**: 60‑day repair completion window [1][3][4].\n\n---\n\n### Q4 – How is each day-based time window defined or described?\n\nSummarized definitions/descriptions:\n\n1. **One (1) year warranty (Builder)**  \n   - “The Builder warrants for a period of one (1) year” that specified structural and system components “will be free of defects in materials or workmanship” [12].  \n   - Term begins at final settlement or first occupancy, whichever comes first [3][4].  \n   - Claims must be made in writing within that one‑year period [3][4].\n\n2. **Sixty (60) day warranty (Builder)**  \n   - “The Builder warrants … for a period of sixty (60) days” that specified items (doors, windows, switches, etc.) will be free of defects [12].  \n   - Same commencement rule as above [3][4].  \n   - Claims must be made in writing within that 60‑day period [3][4].\n\n3. **Warranty termination after one (1) year or sixty (60) days**  \n   - “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement” [3][4].  \n   - Claims not made in writing within those periods are not covered [3][4].\n\n4. **Sixty (60) days to complete repairs**  \n   - After receiving written notice of a covered defect, “the Builder will repair or replace it at no charge … within sixty (60) days (longer if weather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages cause delays)” [1][3][4].\n\n5. **Arbitration demand window – 60 days**  \n   - Arbitration may be demanded “before the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross‑claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above” [1].\n\n6. **Arbitration completion target – 180 days**  \n   - Parties agree “to take any action necessary to conclude an arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator” [9][10][11].  \n   - Arbitrator may impose sanctions for failure to proceed within the times established [9][10][11].\n\n7. **Labor warranty – 90 days (Purchase Contract)**  \n   - “Contractor warrants labor for 90 days” [2][6]. No further detail, but context is installation of the lift.\n\n8. **Right to cancel – 3 business days**  \n   - “Customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited” [2][6].\n\n9. **Property management term – 12 months / one year**  \n   - “This agreement shall be for an initial period of twelve months beginning on: 2010‑06‑15 and shall be automatically renewed for successive one year terms thereafter” [5].\n\n10. **Termination notice – 60 days**  \n    - “However, either party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement” [5].\n\n11. **Short‑term vs long‑term thresholds – 180 days**  \n    - Short‑term/vacation rentals: “reservations of less than 180 days” [5][7][8].  \n    - Long‑term leases: “leases of more than 180 days” [5][7][8].\n\n12. **Owner listing notice – 5 business days**  \n    - Owner must “Provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale” [5].\n\n13. **Holding‑tank contract change filing – 10 business days**  \n    - Owner must file changes or a new service contract “within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract” [14].\n\n14. **Implied warranty limitation to warranty period**  \n    - Any implied warranties that cannot be disclaimed “shall be deemed limited to the warranty period (term) set forth herein” (i.e., the one‑year/60‑day periods) [10][11].\n\n---\n\n### Q5 – Conditions, triggers, and usage contexts for each time window\n\nFor each explicit day‑based window:\n\n- **1‑year builder warranty**  \n  - Length: 1 year [12].  \n  - Trigger: Starts at final settlement or first occupancy, whichever comes first [3][4].  \n  - Use: Defines coverage period for major structural and system components; also limits when claims can be made [12][3][4].\n\n- **60‑day builder warranty**  \n  - Length: 60 days [12].  \n  - Trigger: Same commencement as above [3][4].  \n  - Use: Coverage period for specified minor items; also claim‑filing deadline [12][3][4].\n\n- **60‑day repair completion**  \n  - Length: 60 days from receipt of written defect report [1][3][4].  \n  - Trigger: Builder’s receipt of written notice of a covered defect [1][3][4].  \n  - Use: Performance window for the Builder to repair/replace; may be extended for weather, labor, or material issues [1][3][4].\n\n- **60‑day arbitration demand**  \n  - Length: Up to 60 days after service of complaint/pleading [1].  \n  - Trigger: Service of complaint, third‑party complaint, cross‑claim, counterclaim, answer, or amendment [1].  \n  - Use: Time window to demand binding arbitration instead of proceeding in court [1].\n\n- **180‑day arbitration completion**  \n  - Length: 180 days from filing the dispute with the administrator [9][10][11].  \n  - Trigger: Filing of the dispute with AAA or other administrator [9][10][11].  \n  - Use: Target timeframe to conclude arbitration; arbitrator can impose sanctions for delay [9][10][11].\n\n- **90‑day labor warranty**  \n  - Length: 90 days [2][6].  \n  - Trigger: Implied to start upon completion of the contractor’s work under the purchase contract [2][6].  \n  - Use: Period during which labor defects are covered by the contractor [2][6].\n\n- **3‑business‑day cancellation right**  \n  - Length: 3 business days [2][6].  \n  - Trigger: Contract becomes effective upon mutual signature and initial payment; the 3‑day window runs from that point [2][6].  \n  - Use: Consumer protection window allowing cancellation for full refund; after it expires, deposit is forfeited if customer cancels [2][6].\n\n- **12‑month / one‑year property management term**  \n  - Length: 12 months initial term; successive one‑year renewals [5].  \n  - Trigger: Begins on 2010‑06‑15 [5].  \n  - Use: Defines the duration of the agency relationship and renewal cycle [5].\n\n- **60‑day termination notice (property management)**  \n  - Length: 60 days [5].  \n  - Trigger: Either party giving written notice of termination [5].  \n  - Use: Notice period before the agreement ends; existing reservations remain valid and must be honored [5].\n\n- **<180 days / >180 days rental classification**  \n  - Length: Threshold at 180 days [5][7][8].  \n  - Trigger: Length of reservation/lease.  \n  - Use: Determines whether the agent charges 25% (short‑term, <180 days) or 10% (long‑term, >180 days) commission [5][7][8].\n\n- **5‑business‑day listing notice**  \n  - Length: 5 business days [5].  \n  - Trigger: Owner entering into a listing agreement to sell the property [5].  \n  - Use: Ensures Agent is promptly informed of sale efforts and can manage access and reservations appropriately [5].\n\n- **10‑business‑day holding‑tank contract filing**  \n  - Length: 10 business days [14].  \n  - Trigger: Date of change to the holding‑tank service contract [14].  \n  - Use: Regulatory compliance window to file updated contract with municipality and County [14].\n\n- **Implied warranty limitation to warranty period**  \n  - Length: Same as express warranty term (1 year or 60 days) [10][11].  \n  - Trigger: Any implied warranties that a court finds applicable/not disclaimable [10][11].  \n  - Use: Caps implied warranty duration to the same period as the express limited warranty [10][11].\n\n---\n\n### Q6 – For each window: length, conditions/triggers, and usage\n\nThis has effectively been covered in Q5, but in compact form:\n\n- 1 year – major components warranty; starts at settlement/occupancy; limits coverage and claim period [3][4][12].  \n- 60 days – minor items warranty; same start; limits coverage and claim period [3][4][12].  \n- 60 days – repair completion; starts on written notice; defines performance deadline [1][3][4].  \n- 60 days – arbitration demand; starts on service of complaint/pleading; defines when arbitration can be compelled [1].  \n- 180 days – arbitration completion; starts on filing dispute; target to finish arbitration, with possible sanctions [9][10][11].  \n- 90 days – labor warranty; starts at completion of work; defines labor coverage period [2][6].  \n- 3 business days – cancellation right; starts at contract effectiveness; allows full refund if exercised; after that, deposit forfeited [2][6].  \n- 12 months / 1 year – property management term and renewals; starts on specified date; defines agency duration [5].  \n- 60 days – termination notice; starts when notice given; defines lead time before agreement ends [5].  \n- <180 / >180 days – classification threshold; based on reservation/lease length; determines commission rate [5][7][8].  \n- 5 business days – owner listing notice; starts when listing agreement is signed; ensures timely notice to Agent [5].  \n- 10 business days – filing revised holding‑tank contract; starts on date of change; ensures regulatory compliance [14].  \n- Warranty period as cap on implied warranties – same 1‑year/60‑day term; applies if implied warranties are found; limits their duration [10][11].\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Warranty vs. performance vs. dispute windows**:  \n  - Builder’s 1‑year and 60‑day warranties define how long defects are covered [12], while a separate 60‑day window governs how quickly repairs must be completed after notice [1][3][4].  \n  - Dispute‑resolution windows (60‑day arbitration demand, 180‑day completion) sit on top of those warranty periods, governing how and when disputes are resolved rather than what is covered [1][9][10][11].\n\n- **Consumer protection vs. contractor protection**:  \n  - The 3‑business‑day cancellation window protects the customer (full refund) [2][6], while the 90‑day labor warranty and forfeiture of deposit after 3 days protect the contractor by limiting long‑term exposure [2][6].\n\n- **Operational vs. regulatory timeframes**:  \n  - Operational/contractual windows: property management term (12 months), 60‑day termination notice, 5‑business‑day listing notice, 180‑day rental threshold [5][7][8].  \n  - Regulatory/administrative windows: 10‑business‑day filing of holding‑tank contract changes [14]; reporting obligations in the holding‑tank contract are tied to service dates [14].\n\n- **Classification thresholds**:  \n  - The 180‑day threshold is used both as a classification boundary (short‑ vs long‑term rentals) [5][7][8] and as a target duration for arbitration proceedings [9][10][11], but in different contexts (fee structure vs. dispute resolution).\n\n- **Notice vs. action windows**:  \n  - Some windows govern notice (5‑day listing notice, 60‑day termination notice, 60‑day arbitration demand) [1][5].  \n  - Others govern action/performance (60‑day repair completion, 180‑day arbitration completion, 10‑day filing of contract changes) [1][9][10][11][14].  \n  - Others govern coverage/rights (1‑year/60‑day warranties, 90‑day labor warranty, 3‑day cancellation) [2][3][4][6][12].\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the corpus, the explicit day‑based “time windows” are:\n\n- 1‑year and 60‑day warranty periods (builder) with associated claim deadlines and implied‑warranty caps [3][4][10][11][12].  \n- A 60‑day window for completing repairs after notice [1][3][4].  \n- A 60‑day window to demand arbitration after service of a complaint, and a 180‑day target to conclude arbitration after filing [1][9][10][11].  \n- A 90‑day labor warranty (purchase contract) [2][6].  \n- A 3‑business‑day cancellation window for full refund, after which the deposit is forfeited [2][6].  \n- A 12‑month initial term and successive one‑year renewals for the property management agreement, with a 60‑day written termination notice requirement [5].  \n- A 180‑day threshold distinguishing short‑term (<180 days) from long‑term (>180 days) rentals/leases, which drives commission rates [5][7][8].  \n- A 5‑business‑day window for the owner to notify the Agent of a listing agreement [5].  \n- A 10‑business‑day window to file changes to the holding‑tank service contract with local authorities [14].\n\nThese windows differ in length (from 3 business days to 1 year), in what triggers them (contract signing, occupancy, service of legal papers, filing of disputes, entering a listing agreement, changing a service contract), and in their usage (defining warranty coverage, consumer cancellation rights, contract term and termination, rental classification, dispute resolution timelines, and regulatory compliance). Together, they constitute the set of explicit day‑based timeframes that define or describe “time windows” across the documents.",

BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY\n\n**Warranty coverage periods**\n\n- Structural components, plumbing, heating, wiring, roof:  \n  - “for a period of **one (1) year**” [12]  \n- Doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, cabinet work:  \n  - “for a period of **sixty (60) days**” [12]\n\n**Term of warranty and claim window**\n\n- Warranty term begins on:  \n  - “the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first” [3][4]  \n- Termination of coverage:  \n  - “terminate **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) days** as applicable after commencement” [3][4]  \n- Claim filing deadline:  \n  - “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING … WITHIN **ONE (1) YEAR** OR **SIXTY (60)** AS APPLICABLE … ARE NOT COVERED.” [3][4]  \n  (This creates explicit 1‑year and 60‑day claim windows.)\n\n**Notification and repair timeframes**\n\n- Notification of defects must occur “prior to the termination of the **one (1) year** or **sixty (60) day** warranty period as applicable” [3][4].  \n- Builder’s repair window:  \n  - “repair or replace it at no charge … within **sixty (60) days** (longer if weather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages cause delays)” [1][7].\n\n**Arbitration timing**\n\n- Demand for arbitration:  \n  - “upon the demand of a party … made before the institution of any judicial proceeding or **not more than 60 days** after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above” [1].  \n- Target duration of arbitration:  \n  - Parties agree “to conclude an arbitration hereunder within **180 days** of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator” [9][10][11].\n\nThese create multiple explicit day-based time windows: 60 days, 1 year, and 180 days, tied to coverage, claims, repairs, and dispute resolution.\n\n---\n\n### 2. PURCHASE CONTRACT (Contoso Lifts)\n\n**Warranty period**\n\n- “Contractor warrants labor for **90 days**.” [2][6]  \n  (Explicit 90‑day labor warranty window.)\n\n**Right to cancel**\n\n- “Customer may cancel within **3 business days** for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.” [2][6]  \n  (Explicit 3‑business‑day cancellation window.)\n\nNo other explicit day-count windows (e.g., for delivery) are given; delivery is in “8–10 weeks” which is week-based, not day-based [2][6].\n\n---\n\n### 3. PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT\n\n**Initial term and renewals**\n\n- “initial period of **twelve months** beginning on: 2010-06-15 and shall be automatically renewed for successive **one year** terms thereafter” [5].  \n  (Year-based, but not expressed in days.)\n\n**Termination notice**\n\n- “either party upon **60 (60) days** written notice may terminate this agreement” [5].  \n  (Explicit 60‑day notice window.)\n\n**Owner’s notification duty when listing property for sale**\n\n- Owner must “Provide Agent with written notification within **five (5) business days** of a listing agreement if the property is for sale” [5].  \n  (Explicit 5‑business‑day window.)\n\n**Rental length thresholds (day-based definitions)**\n\n- Short-term/vacation rentals: “reservations of **less than 180 days**” [5][7][8].  \n- Long-term leases: “leases of **more than 180 days**” [5][7][8].  \n\nThese 180‑day thresholds define time windows that distinguish short-term vs. long-term rentals.\n\n---\n\n### 4. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT\n\n**Change-notification window**\n\n- On change of contract:  \n  - Owner agrees to file a copy of changes “with the municipality and the County named above within **ten (10) business days** from the date of change to this service contract” [14].  \n\nNo other explicit day-based windows are specified (servicing dates are reported but not constrained by a fixed day-count window).\n\n---\n\n### 5. CONTOSO LIFTS INVOICE\n\nThe invoice references a due date “Due on contract signing” [15], but no explicit day-count (e.g., “within 30 days”) is given. Thus, there is **no explicit day-based timeframe** in this document.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\nAcross the documents, the “time windows” fall into a few functional categories:\n\n1. **Warranty and service windows**\n   - 1‑year and 60‑day warranty periods and claim deadlines for construction defects [12][3][4].  \n   - 60‑day repair completion window [1][7].  \n   - 90‑day labor warranty for lift installation [2][6].\n\n2. **Cancellation and termination windows**\n   - 3‑business‑day cancellation right for the lift purchase contract [2][6].  \n   - 60‑day written notice to terminate the property management agreement [5].\n\n3. **Notification windows**\n   - Claims must be made within the 1‑year or 60‑day warranty periods [3][4].  \n   - Owner must notify agent of a listing within 5 business days [5].  \n   - Owner must file changes to the holding tank service contract within 10 business days [14].\n\n4. **Dispute resolution windows**\n   - Arbitration demand must be made no more than 60 days after service of pleadings [1].  \n   - Arbitration should be concluded within 180 days of filing [9][10][11].\n\n5. **Classification thresholds**\n   - Short-term vs. long-term rentals defined by a 180‑day threshold [5][7][8].\n\nThese windows can be compared as follows:\n\n- **Short windows (≤10 business days):**  \n  - 3 business days (cancellation) [2][6]; 5 business days (notify listing) [5]; 10 business days (file contract changes) [14].\n- **Medium windows (60–90 days):**  \n  - 60 days (warranty on certain items, claim deadline, repair completion, arbitration demand, termination notice) [12][3][4][1][7][5]; 90 days (labor warranty) [2][6].\n- **Long windows (≥180 days / 1 year):**  \n  - 180 days (arbitration completion target; rental classification threshold) [9][10][11][5][7][8]; 1 year (structural warranty, overall warranty term) [12][3][4].\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAll explicit **day-based timeframes (“time windows”)** across the provided documents are:\n\n- **3 business days** – Customer cancellation window for full refund in the purchase contract [2][6].  \n- **5 business days** – Owner must notify agent of a listing agreement if the property is for sale [5].  \n- **10 business days** – Owner must file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and county [14].  \n- **60 days** –  \n  - Warranty period for specified items (doors, windows, switches, etc.) [12].  \n  - Termination of 60‑day warranty coverage and claim deadline [3][4].  \n  - Exclusion of claims not made within the 60‑day warranty period [3][4].  \n  - Builder’s repair completion window after receiving written defect report [1][7].  \n  - Time limit to demand arbitration after service of pleadings [1].  \n  - 60‑day written notice required to terminate the property management agreement [5].  \n- **90 days** – Contractor’s labor warranty period in the purchase contract [2][6].  \n- **180 days** –  \n  - Target to conclude arbitration after filing a dispute [9][10][11].  \n  - Threshold distinguishing short-term rentals (“less than 180 days”) from long-term leases (“more than 180 days”) [5][7][8].  \n- **One (1) year** –  \n  - Warranty period for structural components, plumbing, heating, wiring, and roof [12].  \n  - Overall warranty term and claim deadline for covered defects [3][4].\n\nThese are the explicit day-based timeframes that define the various contractual “time windows” across the corpus.",

date of change to service contract).[5][14]  \n  - Arbitration-related periods start from service of a complaint (60 days) or filing of a dispute (180 days).[1][9][10][11]\n\n- Some are **classification thresholds** rather than “windows”:\n  - “less than 180 days” vs. “more than 180 days” classify rental types and fee structures, not deadlines.[5][7][8]\n\n**Patterns and overlaps**\n\n- **60-day motif in the Builders Warranty**:\n  - 60 days appears repeatedly: limited warranty for certain items, alternative warranty term vs. one year, claim deadline, repair completion time, and arbitration demand deadline.[1][3][4][7][12][13]  \n  - This creates a consistent short-term horizon for both performance (repairs) and procedural steps (claims, arbitration).\n\n- **Short notice vs. longer operational periods**:\n  - Very short windows (3, 5, 10 business days) govern **notifications and rights** (cancellation, listing notice, filing contract changes).[2][5][14]  \n  - Medium windows (60, 90 days, 8–10 weeks) govern **warranty performance and delivery**.[1][2][3][4][6][7][12][13]  \n  - Long windows (180 days) govern **arbitration completion** and **rental classification**.[5][7][8][9][10][11]\n\n- **No direct cross-document overlap in obligations**:\n  - The 60‑day periods in the Builders Warranty do not interact with the 60‑day termination notice in the Property Management Agreement; they apply to different parties and contracts.[1][3][4][5]  \n  - The 180‑day arbitration completion target is independent of the 180‑day rental classification thresholds, though they share the same numeric value.[5][7][8][9][10][11]\n\n- **Business days vs. calendar days**:\n  - “Business days” is used for customer cancellation (3), listing notice (5), and filing contract changes (10), emphasizing working-day constraints.[2][5][14]  \n  - Other periods (60, 90, 180 days, 8–10 weeks) are expressed without “business,” implying calendar days or weeks.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Original phrasing preserved**: Each timeframe is quoted exactly as written (“sixty (60) days,” “3 business days,” “less than 180 days”), satisfying Q1 and Q4.[1][2][3][4][5][7][8][12][13][14]\n\n- **Clear mapping from timeframe to obligation/event**:\n  - Warranty coverage and claims (Builders Warranty, Purchase Contract) are tied to 60‑day, 90‑day, and 1‑year periods.[1][2][3][4][6][7][12][13]  \n  - Contractual rights and notices (cancellation, termination, listing notice, filing changes) are tied to 3, 5, 10, and 60‑day windows.[2][5][14]  \n  - Arbitration procedure is governed by 60‑day and 180‑day windows.[1][9][10][11]  \n  - Rental classification and fee structure hinge on “less than 180 days” vs. “more than 180 days.”[5][7][8]\n\n- **Comparative structure across documents**:\n  - All contracts use short day-based windows for **time-sensitive actions** (cancellation, notices, filing, arbitration demand).[1][2][5][14]  \n  - Longer day-based windows (60–180 days) are used for **performance and process completion** (repairs, arbitration, rental periods).[1][3][4][7][9][10][11][12][13]\n\nThese connections collectively answer Q2, Q5, Q3, and Q6 by showing what each timeframe controls and how the durations relate and pattern across the corpus.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the provided documents, the explicit day-based time windows are:\n\n- “sixty (60) days” (multiple warranty and repair contexts, and arbitration demand) in the Builders Limited Warranty.[1][3][4][7][12][13]  \n- “one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable” and related claim/notice formulations.[3][4][6]  \n- “within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute” for arbitration completion.[9][10][11]  \n- “Delivery expected 8-10 weeks after drawing approval,” “Contractor warrants labor for 90 days,” and “Customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund” in the purchase contract.[2][6]  \n- “upon sixty (60) days written notice,” “within five (5) business days,” “reservations of less than 180 days,” and “leases of more than 180 days” in the property management agreement.[5][7][8]  \n- “within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract” in the holding tank servicing contract.[14]\n\nFunctionally, shorter windows (3–10 business days) govern immediate rights and notices; medium windows (60–90 days, 8–10 weeks) govern warranty and delivery performance; and longer windows (180 days) govern arbitration timelines and rental classifications. Together, these explicit day-based timeframes define the operative “time windows” for rights, obligations, and classifications across the set.",

Afterward, deposit is forfeited.”** – Customer’s right to cancel the contract and receive a full refund is limited to the first 3 business days; after that, the deposit is lost if they cancel.[2][6]\n\n**Property Management Agreement**\n\n10. **“upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement”** – Either party may terminate the management agreement by giving 60 days’ written notice.[5]\n\n11. **“within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale”** – Owner must notify Agent in writing within 5 business days after entering a listing agreement to sell the property.[5]\n\n12. **“reservations of less than 180 days”** – Defines short-term/vacation rentals for which the Agent’s management fee is 25% of gross revenues.[5][7][8]\n\n13. **“leases of more than 180 days”** – Defines long-term leases for which the Agent’s management fee is 10% of gross revenues.[5][7][8]\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n\n14. **“within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract”** – If the contract changes or a new service contract is made, the owner must file a copy with the municipality and County within 10 business days.[14]\n\n---\n\n### Q3 & Q6: Comparison of all explicit day-based timeframes\n\n**By duration (shortest to longest)**\n\n- **3 business days** – Customer cancellation right in the purchase contract.[2][6]  \n- **5 business days** – Owner’s deadline to notify Agent of a listing agreement.[5]  \n- **10 business days** – Owner’s deadline to file changes/new holding tank service contract.[14]  \n- **60 days / sixty (60) days** – Multiple uses:\n  - Warranty period for certain home components.[12][13]  \n  - Alternative shorter warranty term vs. one year, including claim deadline.[3][4]  \n  - Deadline to send written defect notice (tied to that 60‑day or 1‑year period).[3][4][6]  \n  - Time for Builder to complete repairs.[1][7]  \n  - Deadline to demand arbitration after being served with a complaint.[1]  \n- **90 days** – Labor warranty period in the purchase contract.[2][6]  \n- **8–10 weeks** – Delivery window (approx. 56–70 days) for the lift.[2][6]  \n- **180 days** –  \n  - Target to conclude arbitration.[9][10][11]  \n  - Threshold distinguishing short-term rentals (“less than 180 days”) from long-term leases (“more than 180 days”).[5][7][8]\n\n**Start and end points**\n\n- Many periods are **relative**:\n  - Warranty periods start at “commencement” (date of final settlement or first occupancy) and end after one year or 60 days.[3][4]  \n  - Labor warranty starts at completion of work (implied) and lasts 90 days.[2][6]  \n  - Cancellation period starts at contract signing and lasts 3 business days.[2][6]  \n  - Notice periods (5, 10 business days) start from specific triggering events (listing agreement; date of change to service contract).[5][14]  \n  - Arbitration-related periods start from service of a complaint (60 days) or filing of a dispute (180 days).[1][9][10][11]\n\n- Some are **classification thresholds** rather than “windows”:\n  - “less than 180 days” vs. “more than 180 days” classify rental types and fee structures, not deadlines.[5][7][8]\n\n**Patterns and overlaps**\n\n- **60-day motif in the Builders Warranty**:\n  - 60 days appears repeatedly: limited warranty for certain items, alternative warranty term vs. one year, claim deadline, repair completion time, and arbitration demand deadline.[1][3][4][7][12][13]  \n  - This creates a consistent short-term horizon for both performance (repairs) and procedural steps (claims, arbitration).\n\n- **Short notice vs. longer operational periods**:\n  - Very short windows (3, 5, 10 business days) govern **notifications and rights** (cancellation, listing notice, filing contract changes).[2][5][14]  \n  - Medium windows (60, 90 days, 8–10 weeks) govern **warranty performance and delivery**.[1][2][3][4][6][7][12][13]  \n  - Long windows (180 days) govern **arbitration completion** and **rental classification**.[5][7][8][9][10][11]\n\n- **No direct cross-document overlap in obligations**:\n  - The 60‑day periods in the Builders Warranty do not interact with the 60‑day termination notice in the Property Management Agreement; they apply to different parties and contracts.[1][3][4][5]  \n  - The 180‑day arbitration completion target is independent of the 180‑day rental classification thresholds, though they share the same numeric value.[5][7][8][9][10][11]\n\n- **Business days vs. calendar days**:\n  - “Business days” is used for customer cancellation (3), listing notice (5), and filing contract changes (10), emphasizing working-day constraints.[2][5][14]  \n  - Other periods (60, 90, 180 days, 8–10 weeks) are expressed without “business,” implying calendar days or weeks.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Original phrasing preserved**: Each timeframe is quoted exactly as written (“sixty (60) days,” “3 business days,” “less than 180 days”), satisfying Q1 and Q4.[1][2][3][4][5][7][8][12][13][14]\n\n- **Clear mapping from timeframe to obligation/event**:\n  - Warranty coverage and claims (Builders Warranty, Purchase Contract) are tied to 60‑day, 90‑day, and 1‑year periods.[1][2][3][4][6][7][12][13]  \n  - Contractual rights and notices (cancellation, termination, listing notice, filing changes) are tied to 3, 5, 10, and 60‑day windows.[2][5][14]  \n  - Arbitration procedure is governed by 60‑day and 180‑day windows.[1][9][10][11]  \n  - Rental classification and fee structure hinge on “less than 180 days” vs. “more than 180 days.”[5][7][8]\n\n- **Comparative structure across documents**:\n  - All contracts use short day-based windows for **time-sensitive actions** (cancellation, notices, filing, arbitration demand).[1][2][5][14]  \n  - Longer day-based windows (60–180 days) are used for **performance and process completion** (repairs, arbitration, rental periods).[1][3][4][7][9][10][11][12][13]\n\nThese connections collectively answer Q2, Q5, Q3, and Q6 by showing what each timeframe controls and how the durations relate and pattern across the corpus.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the provided documents, the explicit day-based time windows are:\n\n- “sixty (60) days” (multiple warranty and repair contexts, and arbitration demand) in the Builders Limited Warranty.[1][3][4][7][12][13]  \n- “one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable” and related claim/notice formulations.[3][4][6]  \n- “within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute” for arbitration completion.[9][10][11]  \n- “Delivery expected 8-10 weeks after drawing approval,” “Contractor warrants labor for 90 days,” and “Customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund” in the purchase contract.[2][6]  \n- “upon sixty (60) days written notice,” “within five (5) business days,” “reservations of less than 180 days,” and “leases of more than 180 days” in the property management agreement.[5][7][8]  \n- “within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract” in the holding tank servicing contract.[14]\n\nFunctionally, shorter windows (3–10 business days) govern immediate rights and notices; medium windows (60–90 days, 8–10 weeks) govern warranty and delivery performance; and longer windows (180 days) govern arbitration timelines and rental classifications. Together, these explicit day-based timeframes define the operative “time windows” for rights, obligations, and classifications across the set.",

How “coverage start” is defined\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty does not use the phrase “coverage start,” but it explicitly defines when the warranty term begins in Section 2 (“Term”):\n\n> “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on **the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first**.”【10†L2-L2】【20†L2-L2】\n\nSo, the coverage start is triggered by the earlier of two events:\n1. The date of final settlement (i.e., closing/financial settlement), or  \n2. The date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home.\n\nWhichever of these happens first is the “commencement” of the warranty term【29†L2-L2】【35†L2-L2】.\n\n### Q2. What must happen before coverage ends, and how that relates to the start\n\nOnce coverage has commenced (on the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy), the warranty specifies when and how it ends:\n\n1. **Fixed time limits after commencement**\n\n   Section 2(B) states:\n\n   > “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate **one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**.”【10†L2-L2】【29†L2-L2】\n\n   This ties the end of coverage directly to the defined start (“commencement”):\n   - Certain coverages (e.g., structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical, roof) last **one year** from the coverage start【10†L1-L1】.\n   - Other items (doors, windows, switches, fixtures, caulking, cabinet work) last **60 days** from the coverage start【10†L1-L1】.\n   - After those respective periods (1 year or 60 days) measured from the commencement date, coverage ends unless otherwise provided.\n\n2. **Requirement that claims be made in writing before the period expires**\n\n   The same subsection adds:\n\n   > “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.”【10†L2-L2】【29†L2-L2】\n\n   And the exclusions section reiterates:\n\n   > “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.”【10†L4-L4】【35†L4-L4】\n\n   Thus, for coverage to apply:\n   - The defect must arise within the applicable 1‑year or 60‑day period measured from the coverage start, **and**\n   - The Buyer/Owner must submit a written claim (by certified mail as described in the Notification of Defects section) **before** that period expires【10†L6-L6】【35†L6-L6】.\n\n   If no written claim is made within the applicable time window after commencement, coverage effectively ends for that issue.\n\n3. **Automatic termination upon sale or move‑out**\n\n   Section 8 (“Not Transferable”) provides another end‑of‑coverage trigger:\n\n   > “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. **In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.**”【10†L8-L8】【20†L8-L8】\n\n   So, even if the 1‑year or 60‑day period has not yet elapsed from the coverage start, the warranty ends immediately if:\n   - The first purchaser sells the home, or\n   - The first purchaser moves out of the home.\n\n4. **Exclusions that function as practical limits**\n\n   The exclusions section lists categories of defects and damages that are never covered (e.g., ordinary wear and tear, defects covered by manufacturers’ warranties, damage from insects, fire, acts of God, etc.)【10†L4-L4】【20†L4-L4】. While these do not change the time period, they define circumstances where, even during the coverage period, no coverage exists.\n\n   Additionally, failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency can relieve the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and other damages【10†L6-L6】, which can effectively cut off coverage for that situation even before the formal term ends.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Start tied to events; end tied to elapsed time from that start.**  \n  Coverage begins at “commencement,” defined as the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy【10†L2-L2】. The 1‑year and 60‑day coverage periods are explicitly measured “after commencement”【29†L2-L2】, so the end date is calculated directly from that start date.\n\n- **End of coverage depends on both time and actions.**  \n  Even within the 1‑year or 60‑day window, coverage can be lost if:\n  - The Buyer/Owner fails to submit a written claim within that window【10†L2-L2】【35†L4-L4】, or\n  - The first purchaser sells or moves out, which automatically terminates the warranty【10†L8-L8】.\n\n- **Exclusions overlay the time framework.**  \n  The exclusions and notification requirements operate within the same start–end framework: they don’t change when the clock starts, but they define when, despite the clock still running, coverage does not apply【10†L4-L4】【35†L6-L6】.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this Builders Limited Warranty, the “coverage start” is defined as the earlier of (a) the date of final settlement or (b) the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home; this earlier date is the “commencement” of the warranty term【10†L2-L2】. From that commencement date, different coverages run for either one year or sixty days, and they terminate one year or sixty days “after commencement,” respectively【29†L2-L2】. For coverage to apply, any claim must be made in writing within the applicable 1‑year or 60‑day period measured from that start date【10†L2-L2】【35†L4-L4】. Coverage also ends automatically if, before those periods expire, the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, because the warranty is non‑transferable and terminates upon sale or move‑out【10†L8-L8】.",

Therefore, the purchase contract total price is:\n\n- **$29,900.00**【2†L23-L29】.\n\n### Q2 & Q6: Invoice total amount\n\nThe Contoso Lifts LLC invoice #1256003 lists the following monetary summary:\n\n- **SUBTOTAL**: 29,900.00【1†L40-L47】  \n- **TAX**: N/A【1†L40-L47】  \n- **TOTAL**: 29,900.00【1†L40-L47】  \n- **AMOUNT DUE**: 29,900.00【1†L40-L47】  \n\nNo discounts or extra fees are shown; tax is explicitly “N/A”【1†L40-L47】. Thus, when summing all line items and applicable components, the resulting invoice total is:\n\n- **$29,900.00**【1†L40-L47】.\n\n### Q4 & Q5: Invoice components and their values\n\nThe invoice line items are:\n\n1. Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504) – Qty 1  \n   - Unit price: 11,200.00  \n   - Line total: 11,200.00【1†L26-L33】\n\n2. 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts – Qty 1  \n   - Unit price: 3,000.00  \n   - Line total: 3,000.00【1†L26-L33】\n\n3.

Outdoor fitting – Qty 1  \n   - Unit price: 2,000.00  \n   - Line total: 2,000.00【1†L26-L33】\n\n5. 80\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts, WR-500 lock, automatic door operator – Qty 1  \n   - Unit price: 5,000.00  \n   - Line total: 5,000.00【1†L26-L33】\n\n6. Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing – Qty 2  \n   - Unit price: 1,450.00  \n   - Line total: 2,900.00【1†L26-L33】\n\nSumming these line totals:\n\n- 11,200.00 + 3,000.00 + 5,800.00 + 2,000.00 + 5,000.00 + 2,900.00  \n  = **29,900.00** (this matches the invoice SUBTOTAL)【1†L26-L33】【1†L40-L47】.\n\nThere are:\n\n- **No taxes applied** (TAX: N/A)【1†L40-L47】  \n- **No separate fees or discounts** listed.\n\nThus, the invoice total of $29,900.00 is entirely the sum of these six line items【1†L26-L33】【1†L40-L47】.\n\n### Q3 & Q7: Comparison of contract total vs. invoice total\n\n- Purchase contract total price: **$29,900.00**【2†L23-L29】.  \n- Invoice total (and amount due): **$29,900.00**【1†L40-L47】.\n\nNumerically, these amounts are identical. There is no discrepancy, surcharge, or discount shown on the invoice relative to the contract total.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **scope of work** in the purchase contract (lift, power system, custom cab, outdoor package, aluminum door, hall call stations)【2†L11-L20】matches the types of items listed on the invoice (lift, power system, special cab, outdoor fitting, aluminum door with operator, hall call stations)【1†L26-L33】, indicating the invoice is for the contracted system.\n- The **contract’s total price** of $29,900.00【2†L23-L29】is mirrored exactly as the **invoice subtotal, total, and amount due**【1†L40-L47】.\n- No additional monetary components (taxes, fees, or discounts) appear on either document that would alter the $29,900.00 figure【1†L40-L47】【2†L23-L29】.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total **do match exactly**. The matching amount is:\n\n- **$29,900.00**【2†L23-L29】【1†L40-L47】.",

Document with a percentage-based fee structure and how it is defined\n\nThe **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** describes several “fees” that are calculated as percentages of underlying amounts:\n\n- A **25% commission** “of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days)”[13].\n- A **10% commission** “of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days)”[13].\n- A **10% fee** “on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations”[13].\n- In addition, the Agent will charge the **Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges**[13].\n\nAll of these are percentage-based: the fee is calculated as a stated percentage of either gross rental revenues or the total cost of repairs/renovations, and then the excise tax is a percentage applied on top of those fees[13].\n\nTherefore, the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the document that clearly uses a **percentage-based fee structure**, defined as specific percentage commissions and fees applied to gross revenues and repair/upgrade charges, plus a percentage tax on those fees[13].\n\n### Q2. Document with fixed installment payments and how they are defined\n\nThe **PURCHASE CONTRACT** sets out a fixed, installment-style payment structure for the total contract price:\n\n- “Total contract price is **$29,900.00, payable in 3 installments**:\n  - **$20,000.00 upon signing**\n  - **$7,000.00 upon delivery**\n  - **$2,900.00 upon completion**”[4][5].\n\nThese are **fixed dollar amounts**, tied to specific milestones (signing, delivery, completion), not percentages of a variable base. The total is predetermined and broken into three installments with exact amounts and timing conditions[4][5].\n\nTherefore, the **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that uses a **fixed installment payment structure**, defined as three specified dollar amounts due at defined project milestones[4][5].\n\n### Q3. Comparison of percentage-based fees vs. fixed installment payments\n\n**How fees are calculated**\n\n- **Percentage-based structure (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT)**:\n  - Fees are calculated as a **percentage of variable amounts**:\n    - 25% or 10% of **gross rental revenues**, depending on whether the rental is short-term or long-term[13].\n    - 10% of the **total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations**[13].\n    - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax applied to “all the above fees, commissions and charges”[13].\n  - This means the actual dollar amount of the fee fluctuates with:\n    - How much rental income the property generates.\n    - How much is spent on repairs/renovations.\n    - The more revenue or repair spend, the higher the fee.\n\n- **Fixed installment structure (PURCHASE CONTRACT)**:\n  - Payments are **fixed dollar amounts** that sum to the total contract price:\n    - $20,000 + $7,000 + $2,900 = $29,900[4][5].\n  - The amounts do **not change** based on usage, revenue, or costs (unless the contract is formally changed under the “Changes” clause[4][5]).\n  - The calculation is straightforward: the total price is predetermined, and each installment is a set portion of that total.\n\n**How and when fees are paid**\n\n- **Percentage-based fees**:\n  - Paid **out of or in relation to ongoing activity**:\n    - Management commissions are tied to rental revenues, so they are typically assessed as revenue is earned and accounted for in periodic statements[17][13].\n    - The 10% repair/upgrade fee is assessed when such work is done and charged[13].\n    - The excise tax is added on top of those fees when they are charged[13].\n  - Timing is therefore **ongoing and variable**, aligned with rental cycles and maintenance events.\n\n- **Fixed installments**:\n  - Paid at **specific, one-time milestones**:\n    - Upon contract signing, upon delivery, and upon completion[4][5].\n  - Once the three installments are paid, the payment obligation for the contract price is complete (subject to any later agreed changes)[4][5].\n  - Timing is **discrete and milestone-based**, not tied to ongoing revenue or usage.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **percentage-based fee structure** appears in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**, where the agent’s compensation and certain charges are defined as percentages of gross revenues and repair costs, plus a percentage tax on those fees[13].\n- The **fixed installment payment structure** appears in the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**, where the total price is split into three fixed dollar installments due at defined project milestones[4][5].\n- Conceptually:\n  - The property management fees are **variable and performance/volume-based** (they scale with income and spending)[13].\n  - The purchase contract payments are **fixed and schedule-based**, independent of future performance or usage[4][5].\n\nTogether, these two documents illustrate two distinct “fees” concepts: one where the fee is a **percentage of an underlying economic activity**, and one where the fee is a **fixed set of installments toward a known total price**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** describes the **percentage-based fee structure**, defining multiple fees and commissions as specific percentages of gross rental revenues and repair/upgrade charges, plus a 4.712% excise tax on those fees[13].\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** describes the **fixed installment payment structure**, defining a total contract price of $29,900.00 payable in three fixed installments of $20,000.00 upon signing, $7,000.00 upon delivery, and $2,900.00 upon completion[4][5].\n- Compared:\n  - The percentage-based structure yields **variable fees** that rise or fall with revenues and costs and are paid as those activities occur[13].\n  - The fixed installment structure uses **predetermined amounts** paid at specific milestones, with the total known in advance and not dependent on later performance[4][5].",
            "text_norm": " analysis  q1. document with a percentage-based fee structure and how it is defined the property management agreement describes several fees that are calculated as percentages of underlying amounts: - a 25% commission of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals reservations of less than 180 days13. - a 10% commission of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases leases of more than 180 days13. - a 10% fee on the total charge for repairs upgrades and/or renovations13. - in addition the agent will charge the hawaii gross excise tax currently at 4.712% on all the above fees commissions and charges13. all of these are percentage-based: the fee is calculated as a stated percentage of either gross rental revenues or the total cost of repairs/renovations and then the excise tax is a percentage applied on top of those fees13. therefore the property management agreement is the document that clearly uses a percentage-based fee structure defined as specific percentage commissions and fees applied to gross revenues and repair/upgrade charges plus a percentage tax on those fees13.  q2. document with fixed installment payments and how they are defined the purchase contract sets out a fixed installment-style payment structure for the total contract price: - total contract price is $29900.00 payable in 3 installments: - $20000.00 upon signing - $7000.00 upon delivery - $2900.00 upon completion45. these are fixed dollar amounts tied to specific milestones signing delivery completion not percentages of a variable base. the total is predetermined and broken into three installments with exact amounts and timing conditions45. therefore the purchase contract is the document that uses a fixed installment payment structure defined as three specified dollar amounts due at defined project milestones45.  q3. comparison of percentage-based fees vs. fixed installment payments how fees are calculated - percentage-based structure property management agreement: - fees are calculated as a percentage of variable amounts: - 25% or 10% of gross rental revenues depending on whether the rental is short-term or long-term13. - 10% of the total charge for repairs upgrades and/or renovations13. - 4.712% hawaii gross excise tax applied to all the above fees commissions and charges13. - this means the actual dollar amount of the fee fluctuates with: - how much rental income the property generates. - how much is spent on repairs/renovations. - the more revenue or repair spend the higher the fee. - fixed installment structure purchase contract: - payments are fixed dollar amounts that sum to the total contract price: - $20000  $7000  $2900  $2990045. - the amounts do not change based on usage revenue or costs unless the contract is formally changed under the changes clause45. - the calculation is straightforward: the total price is predetermined and each installment is a set portion of that total. how and when fees are paid - percentage-based fees: - paid out of or in relation to ongoing activity: - management commissions are tied to rental revenues so they are typically assessed as revenue is earned and accounted for in periodic statements1713. - the 10% repair/upgrade fee is assessed when such work is done and charged13. - the excise tax is added on top of those fees when they are charged13. - timing is therefore ongoing and variable aligned with rental cycles and maintenance events. - fixed installments: - paid at specific one-time milestones: - upon contract signing upon delivery and upon completion45. - once the three installments are paid the payment obligation for the contract price is complete subject to any later agreed changes45. - timing is discrete and milestone-based not tied to ongoing revenue or usage.  key connections - the percentage-based fee structure appears in the property management agreement where the agents compensation and certain charges are defined as percentages of gross revenues and repair costs plus a percentage tax on those fees13. - the fixed installment payment structure appears in the purchase contract where the total price is split into three fixed dollar installments due at defined project milestones45. - conceptually: - the property management fees are variable and performance/volume-based they scale with income and spending13. - the purchase contract payments are fixed and schedule-based independent of future performance or usage45. together these two documents illustrate two distinct fees concepts: one where the fee is a percentage of an underlying economic activity and one where the fee is a fixed set of installments toward a known total price.  conclusion - the property management agreement describes the percentage-based fee structure defining multiple fees and commissions as specific percentages of gross rental revenues and repair/upgrade charges plus a 4.712% excise tax on those fees13. - the purchase contract describes the fixed installment payment structure defining a total contract price of $29900.00 payable in three fixed installments of $20000.00 upon signing $7000.00 upon delivery and $2900.00 upon completion45. - compared: - the percentage-based structure yields variable fees that rise or fall with revenues and costs and are paid as those activities occur13. - the fixed installment structure uses predetermined amounts paid at specific milestones with the total known in advance and not dependent on later performance45.",

no percentages of revenues or fixed installment plan for fees.[1][2][3][6][7][8]\n\nThus, the clearly defined “fees” concepts relevant to the question are:\n- Percentage-based fee structures: in the PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  \n- Fixed installment payments: in the PURCHASE CONTRACT.\n\n---\n\n### Q2: A “fees” concept that uses a percentage-based fee structure and how it is defined\n\nIn the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**, several fee concepts are explicitly percentage-based:\n\n1. **Short-term/vacation rental management commission**  \n   - Defined as: “A fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).”[13][14][17]  \n   - Percentage: 25%.  \n   - Base: “gross revenues” from short-term/vacation rentals.  \n   - Condition/variation: Applies only to reservations of less than 180 days.[13][14][17]\n\n2. **Long-term lease management commission**  \n   - Defined as: “A fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).”[13][14][17]  \n   - Percentage: 10%.  \n   - Base: “gross revenues” from long-term leases.  \n   - Condition/variation: Applies only to leases of more than 180 days.[13][14][17]\n\n3. **Repairs/upgrades/renovations fee**  \n   - Defined as: “A fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.”[13][14][17]  \n   - Percentage: 10%.  \n   - Base: “the total charge” for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.  \n   - Condition: Applies when such work is done; no separate duration condition stated.[13][14][17]\n\n4. **Hawaii Gross Excise tax on fees**  \n   - Defined as: “Plus, the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.”[13][14][17]  \n   - Percentage: 4.712%.  \n   - Base: “all the above fees, commissions and charges” (i.e., the various fees listed in (a)–(g)).[13][14][17]  \n   - Condition: Applied in addition to the underlying fees; rate is stated as “currently” 4.712%, implying it may change by law.[13][14][17]\n\nThese are classic percentage-based fee structures: a specified percentage applied to a defined monetary base (gross revenues or total charges), with conditions based on rental term or type of expense.\n\n---\n\n### Q3: A “fees” concept that uses fixed installment payments and how those installments are defined\n\nIn the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**, the payment terms define a fixed installment structure:\n\n- “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:”[4][5]  \n  - Installment 1: “$20,000.00 upon signing” – amount and timing tied to contract signing.[4][5]  \n  - Installment 2: “$7,000.00 upon delivery” – amount and timing tied to delivery of the equipment.[4][5]  \n  - Installment 3: “$2,900.00 upon completion” – amount and timing tied to completion of the work.[4][5]\n\nDetails:\n\n- **Amount of each installment**: $20,000.00; $7,000.00; $2,900.00.[4][5]  \n- **Number of installments**: 3.[4][5]  \n- **Timing**: upon signing, upon delivery, upon completion (milestone-based).[4][5]  \n- **Conditions/variations**: Section 3 states that “Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone,” indicating that change orders can alter which installment is affected, but the structure is still fixed-amount milestone payments.[4][5]\n\nThis is a fixed installment payment structure, not a percentage of price or revenues.\n\n---\n\n### Q4: Which documents use percentage-based fee structures and which use fixed installment payments?\n\n- **Percentage-based fee structures**:  \n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** – multiple percentage-based fees and a percentage-based tax (25%, 10%, 10%, and 4.712%) applied to gross revenues or total charges.[13][14][17]\n\n- **Fixed installment payments**:  \n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT** – total price of $29,900.00 split into three fixed installments of $20,000.00, $7,000.00, and $2,900.00 tied to specific milestones.[4][5]\n\nOther documents either do not define a structured fee schedule (HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT, BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY) or present a one-time invoice/price rather than a fee structure (contoso_lifts_invoice).[9][12][1][2][3][6][7][8]\n\n---\n\n### Q5: Specific percentage-based “fees” concepts, with percentages, bases, and conditions\n\nFrom the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:\n\n1. **Short-term/vacation rental management commission**  \n   - Concept: Agent’s management fee for short-term/vacation rentals.  \n   - Percentage: 25%.[13][14][17]  \n   - Base: “gross revenues” from short-term/vacation rentals.[13][14][17]  \n   - Conditions/variations: Applies to “reservations of less than 180 days.”[13][14][17]\n\n2. **Long-term lease management commission**  \n   - Concept: Agent’s management fee for long-term leases.  \n   - Percentage: 10%.[13][14][17]  \n   - Base: “gross revenues” from long term leases.[13][14][17]  \n   - Conditions/variations: Applies to “leases of more than 180 days.”[13][14][17]\n\n3. **Repairs/upgrades/renovations fee**  \n   - Concept: Agent’s fee on repair/upgrade/renovation work.  \n   - Percentage: 10%.[13][14][17]  \n   - Base: “the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.”[13][14][17]  \n   - Conditions/variations: Applies when such work is performed; no duration threshold.\n\n4. **Hawaii Gross Excise tax on fees**  \n   - Concept: Tax charged on the agent’s fees/commissions/charges.  \n   - Percentage: 4.712%.[13][14][17]  \n   - Base: “all the above fees, commissions and charges” (i.e., items (a)–(g) in AGENT’S FEES).[13][14][17]  \n   - Conditions/variations: Rate is described as “currently at 4.712%,” implying it may change with tax law; it is an add-on to the underlying fees.[13][14][17]\n\nThese are the only clearly defined percentage-based fee concepts in the corpus.\n\n---\n\n### Q6: Specific fixed installment “fees” concepts, with amounts, number/timing of installments, and conditions\n\nFrom the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:\n\n- **Concept**: Payment of the contract price for furnishing and installing a vertical platform lift and related components.[4][5][10][11]  \n- **Total amount**: $29,900.00.[4][5]  \n- **Installment structure**:  \n  - Installment 1: $20,000.00 upon signing the contract.[4][5]  \n  - Installment 2: $7,000.00 upon delivery of the equipment.[4][5]  \n  - Installment 3: $2,900.00 upon completion of the work.[4][5]  \n- **Number of installments**: 3.[4][5]  \n- **Timing**: Each installment is due at a specific project milestone (signing, delivery, completion).[4][5]  \n- **Conditions/variations**: Section 3 states that “Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone,” meaning change orders can adjust the amount due at the next milestone, but the structure remains milestone-based fixed payments.[4][5]\n\nNo other document sets out a similar fixed installment fee/payment schedule.\n\n---\n\n### Q7: Classification of each “fees” concept as percentage-based vs fixed installments\n\n**Percentage-based fee concepts (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT)**[13][14][17]:\n\n- 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rental management (reservations < 180 days).  \n- 10% of gross revenues for long-term lease management (leases > 180 days).  \n- 10% of the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.  \n- 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all the above fees, commissions, and charges.\n\n**Fixed-amount but not installment (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT)**[13][14][17]:\n\n- $75.00/month advertising charge (short-term rentals).  \n- $50.00/month minimum administration/accounting charge.  \n- $35/hour scheduling/escort charge.  \n- $250.00 non-refundable agency start-up fee.\n\nThese are fixed recurring or one-time charges, not installments of a larger lump sum.\n\n**Fixed installment payment concept (PURCHASE CONTRACT)**[4][5]:\n\n- Total contract price of $29,900.00 paid in three fixed installments:  \n  - $20,000.00 upon signing.  \n  - $7,000.00 upon delivery.  \n  - $2,900.00 upon completion.\n\nNo percentage-based fee structure is defined in the PURCHASE CONTRACT; it uses fixed milestone installments only.[4][5]\n\nOther documents either do not define a structured fee schedule or only show one-time prices/invoices, not percentage-based fees or installment plans.[9][12][1][2][3][6][7][8]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the only document that clearly defines **percentage-based fee structures**, with percentages applied to **gross revenues** (for management commissions) and to **total charges** (for repairs/renovations), plus a percentage tax on those fees.[13][14][17]\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that clearly defines a **fixed installment payment structure**, splitting a known total price into three fixed dollar amounts due at specific milestones.[4][5]\n- Both documents involve “fees” or payments, but they use fundamentally different structures:\n  - Management/agency context → percentage of revenue/charges (variable with performance).[13][14][17]  \n  - Construction/equipment purchase context → fixed installments of a fixed total price (independent of revenue).[4][5]\n\nThese distinctions directly answer the original comparison between percentage-based fee structures and fixed installment payments.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** contains the **percentage-based fee structures**:  \n  - 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rental management, 10% of gross revenues for long-term lease management, 10% of the total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations, and 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all such fees and charges.[13][14][17]\n\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** contains the **fixed installment payment structure**:  \n  - A total contract price of $29,900.00 paid in three fixed installments of $20,000.00 upon signing, $7,000.00 upon delivery, and $2,900.00 upon completion.[4][5]\n\nThus, for the original query:  \n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the document with percentage-based fee structures.  \n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document with fixed installment payments.",

total contract price of $29900.00 paid in three fixed installments: - $20000.00 upon signing. - $7000.00 upon delivery. - $2900.00 upon completion. no percentage-based fee structure is defined in the purchase contract it uses fixed milestone installments only.45 other documents either do not define a structured fee schedule or only show one-time prices/invoices not percentage-based fees or installment plans.912123678 ---  key connections - the property management agreement is the only document that clearly defines percentage-based fee structures with percentages applied to gross revenues for management commissions and to total charges for repairs/renovations plus a percentage tax on those fees.131417 - the purchase contract is the document that clearly defines a fixed installment payment structure splitting a known total price into three fixed dollar amounts due at specific milestones.45 - both documents involve fees or payments but they use fundamentally different structures: - management/agency context  percentage of revenue/charges variable with performance.131417 - construction/equipment purchase context  fixed installments of a fixed total price independent of revenue.45 these distinctions directly answer the original comparison between percentage-based fee structures and fixed installment payments. ---  conclusion - the property management agreement contains the percentage-based fee structures: - 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rental management 10% of gross revenues for long-term lease management 10% of the total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations and 4.712% hawaii gross excise tax on all such fees and charges.131417 - the purchase contract contains the fixed installment payment structure: - a total contract price of $29900.00 paid in three fixed installments of $20000.00 upon signing $7000.00 upon delivery and $2900.00 upon completion.45 thus for the original query: - the property management agreement is the document with percentage-based fee structures. - the purchase contract is the document with fixed installment payments.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1: “Fees” concepts in each relevant document, and whether they are percentage-based or fixed installments\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT – “AGENT’S FEES”**  \nThis document contains multiple fee concepts, many of which are percentage-based and some of which are fixed dollar amounts or hourly rates:\n\n- 25% commission on gross revenues for short-term/vacation rentals (reservations < 180 days) – percentage-based fee on gross revenues.[13][14][17]  \n- 10% commission on gross revenues for long-term leases (leases > 180 days) – percentage-based fee on gross revenues.[13][14][17]  \n- 10% fee on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations – percentage-based fee on the total repair/upgrade/renovation charge.[13][14][17]  \n- Hawaii Gross Excise tax of 4.712% applied to all the above fees, commissions, and charges – percentage-based tax on the fees/commissions/charges.[13][14][17]  \n- Advertising charge: $75.00 per month – fixed recurring dollar amount (not percentage).[13][14][17]  \n- Administration/accounting minimum charge: $50.00 per month – fixed recurring dollar amount.[13][14][17]  \n- Charge of $35/hour for scheduling/escorting contractors, etc. – fixed hourly rate.[13][14][17]  \n- Agency start-up fee: $250.00, non‑refundable – one-time fixed fee.[13][14][17]\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT – Payment Terms**  \nThe “Total contract price” is paid in fixed installments, not as percentages:\n\n- Total contract price: $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments.[4][5]  \n  - $20,000.00 upon signing.[4][5]  \n  - $7,000.00 upon delivery.[4][5]  \n  - $2,900.00 upon completion.[4][5]  \n\nThese are fixed installment payments tied to milestones, not percentage-based.\n\n**Other documents**\n\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Lists line-item prices and a total of $29,900.00, but this is a one-time invoice amount, not a fee structure with percentages or installments.[9]  \n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: Refers generally to “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon,” but does not define a percentage-based or installment fee structure.[12]  \n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: Discusses arbitration costs and each party paying half the cost and fees of arbitration, but not as a defined “fee schedule” like commissions or installments; no percentages of revenues or fixed installment plan for fees.[1][2][3][6][7][8]\n\nThus, the clearly defined “fees” concepts relevant to the question are:\n- Percentage-based fee structures: in the PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  \n- Fixed installment payments: in the PURCHASE CONTRACT.\n\n---\n\n### Q2: A “fees” concept that uses a percentage-based fee structure and how it is defined\n\nIn the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**, several fee concepts are explicitly percentage-based:\n\n1. **Short-term/vacation rental management commission**  \n   - Defined as: “A fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).”[13][14][17]  \n   - Percentage: 25%.  \n   - Base: “gross revenues” from short-term/vacation rentals.  \n   - Condition/variation: Applies only to reservations of less than 180 days.[13][14][17]\n\n2. **Long-term lease management commission**  \n   - Defined as: “A fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).”[13][14][17]  \n   - Percentage: 10%.  \n   - Base: “gross revenues” from long-term leases.  \n   - Condition/variation: Applies only to leases of more than 180 days.[13][14][17]\n\n3. **Repairs/upgrades/renovations fee**  \n   - Defined as: “A fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.”[13][14][17]  \n   - Percentage: 10%.  \n   - Base: “the total charge” for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.  \n   - Condition: Applies when such work is done; no separate duration condition stated.[13][14][17]\n\n4. **Hawaii Gross Excise tax on fees**  \n   - Defined as: “Plus, the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.”[13][14][17]  \n   - Percentage: 4.712%.  \n   - Base: “all the above fees, commissions and charges” (i.e., the various fees listed in (a)–(g)).[13][14][17]  \n   - Condition: Applied in addition to the underlying fees; rate is stated as “currently” 4.712%, implying it may change by law.[13][14][17]\n\nThese are classic percentage-based fee structures: a specified percentage applied to a defined monetary base (gross revenues or total charges), with conditions based on rental term or type of expense.\n\n---\n\n### Q3: A “fees” concept that uses fixed installment payments and how those installments are defined\n\nIn the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**, the payment terms define a fixed installment structure:\n\n- “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:”[4][5]  \n  - Installment 1: “$20,000.00 upon signing” – amount and timing tied to contract signing.[4][5]  \n  - Installment 2: “$7,000.00 upon delivery” – amount and timing tied to delivery of the equipment.[4][5]  \n  - Installment 3: “$2,900.00 upon completion” – amount and timing tied to completion of the work.[4][5]\n\nDetails:\n\n- **Amount of each installment**: $20,000.00; $7,000.00; $2,900.00.[4][5]  \n- **Number of installments**: 3.[4][5]  \n- **Timing**: upon signing, upon delivery, upon completion (milestone-based).[4][5]  \n- **Conditions/variations**: Section 3 states that “Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone,” indicating that change orders can alter which installment is affected, but the structure is still fixed-amount milestone payments.[4][5]\n\nThis is a fixed installment payment structure, not a percentage of price or revenues.\n\n---\n\n### Q4: Which documents use percentage-based fee structures and which use fixed installment payments?\n\n- **Percentage-based fee structures**:  \n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** – multiple percentage-based fees and a percentage-based tax (25%, 10%, 10%, and 4.712%) applied to gross revenues or total charges.[13][14][17]\n\n- **Fixed installment payments**:  \n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT** – total price of $29,900.00 split into three fixed installments of $20,000.00, $7,000.00, and $2,900.00 tied to specific milestones.[4][5]\n\nOther documents either do not define a structured fee schedule (HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT, BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY) or present a one-time invoice/price rather than a fee structure (contoso_lifts_invoice).[9][12][1][2][3][6][7][8]\n\n---\n\n### Q5: Specific percentage-based “fees” concepts, with percentages, bases, and conditions\n\nFrom the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:\n\n1. **Short-term/vacation rental management commission**  \n   - Concept: Agent’s management fee for short-term/vacation rentals.  \n   - Percentage: 25%.[13][14][17]  \n   - Base: “gross revenues” from short-term/vacation rentals.[13][14][17]  \n   - Conditions/variations: Applies to “reservations of less than 180 days.”[13][14][17]\n\n2. **Long-term lease management commission**  \n   - Concept: Agent’s management fee for long-term leases.  \n   - Percentage: 10%.[13][14][17]  \n   - Base: “gross revenues” from long term leases.[13][14][17]  \n   - Conditions/variations: Applies to “leases of more than 180 days.”[13][14][17]\n\n3. **Repairs/upgrades/renovations fee**  \n   - Concept: Agent’s fee on repair/upgrade/renovation work.  \n   - Percentage: 10%.[13][14][17]  \n   - Base: “the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.”[13][14][17]  \n   - Conditions/variations: Applies when such work is performed; no duration threshold.\n\n4. **Hawaii Gross Excise tax on fees**  \n   - Concept: Tax charged on the agent’s fees/commissions/charges.  \n   - Percentage: 4.712%.[13][14][17]  \n   - Base: “all the above fees, commissions and charges” (i.e., items (a)–(g) in AGENT’S FEES).[13][14][17]  \n   - Conditions/variations: Rate is described as “currently at 4.712%,” implying it may change with tax law; it is an add-on to the underlying fees.[13][14][17]\n\nThese are the only clearly defined percentage-based fee concepts in the corpus.\n\n---\n\n### Q6: Specific fixed installment “fees” concepts, with amounts, number/timing of installments, and conditions\n\nFrom the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:\n\n- **Concept**: Payment of the contract price for furnishing and installing a vertical platform lift and related components.[4][5][10][11]  \n- **Total amount**: $29,900.00.[4][5]  \n- **Installment structure**:  \n  - Installment 1: $20,000.00 upon signing the contract.[4][5]  \n  - Installment 2: $7,000.00 upon delivery of the equipment.[4][5]  \n  - Installment 3: $2,900.00 upon completion of the work.[4][5]  \n- **Number of installments**: 3.[4][5]  \n- **Timing**: Each installment is due at a specific project milestone (signing, delivery, completion).[4][5]  \n- **Conditions/variations**: Section 3 states that “Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone,” meaning change orders can adjust the amount due at the next milestone, but the structure remains milestone-based fixed payments.[4][5]\n\nNo other document sets out a similar fixed installment fee/payment schedule.\n\n---\n\n### Q7: Classification of each “fees” concept as percentage-based vs fixed installments\n\n**Percentage-based fee concepts (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT)**[13][14][17]:\n\n- 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rental management (reservations < 180 days).  \n- 10% of gross revenues for long-term lease management (leases > 180 days).  \n- 10% of the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.  \n- 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all the above fees, commissions, and charges.\n\n**Fixed-amount but not installment (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT)**[13][14][17]:\n\n- $75.00/month advertising charge (short-term rentals).  \n- $50.00/month minimum administration/accounting charge.  \n- $35/hour scheduling/escort charge.  \n- $250.00 non-refundable agency start-up fee.\n\nThese are fixed recurring or one-time charges, not installments of a larger lump sum.\n\n**Fixed installment payment concept (PURCHASE CONTRACT)**[4][5]:\n\n- Total contract price of $29,900.00 paid in three fixed installments:  \n  - $20,000.00 upon signing.  \n  - $7,000.00 upon delivery.  \n  - $2,900.00 upon completion.\n\nNo percentage-based fee structure is defined in the PURCHASE CONTRACT; it uses fixed milestone installments only.[4][5]\n\nOther documents either do not define a structured fee schedule or only show one-time prices/invoices, not percentage-based fees or installment plans.[9][12][1][2][3][6][7][8]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the only document that clearly defines **percentage-based fee structures**, with percentages applied to **gross revenues** (for management commissions) and to **total charges** (for repairs/renovations), plus a percentage tax on those fees.[13][14][17]\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that clearly defines a **fixed installment payment structure**, splitting a known total price into three fixed dollar amounts due at specific milestones.[4][5]\n- Both documents involve “fees” or payments, but they use fundamentally different structures:\n  - Management/agency context → percentage of revenue/charges (variable with performance).[13][14][17]  \n  - Construction/equipment purchase context → fixed installments of a fixed total price (independent of revenue).[4][5]\n\nThese distinctions directly answer the original comparison between percentage-based fee structures and fixed installment payments.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** contains the **percentage-based fee structures**:  \n  - 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rental management, 10% of gross revenues for long-term lease management, 10% of the total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations, and 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all such fees and charges.[13][14][17]\n\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** contains the **fixed installment payment structure**:  \n  - A total contract price of $29,900.00 paid in three fixed installments of $20,000.00 upon signing, $7,000.00 upon delivery, and $2,900.00 upon completion.[4][5]\n\nThus, for the original query:  \n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the document with percentage-based fee structures.  \n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document with fixed installment payments.",

They identify parties such as:\n\n- Fabrikam Inc. and Contoso Ltd. in various roles (builder/buyer, pumper/owner, owner/agent, contractor/customer) [1][2][3][4].  \n\nHowever, there is **no document that is explicitly an invoice**, and none is labeled or formatted as such. Therefore, there is **no identifiable “vendor on the invoice”** in the supplied evidence.\n\nGiven that, Q1 cannot be answered from the evidence: we cannot reliably state who the vendor on the invoice is, because the invoice itself is not present.\n\n### Q2: What exact value is shown as the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice?\n\nThe only explicit “Tax ID” value in the corpus appears in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, where the property’s **Tax ID# 0098765** is listed in the legal description section [2][15][19][24][37][50][67]. This is clearly labeled as a **property Tax ID**, not as a vendor VAT / Tax ID, and it is associated with the parcel, not with Fabrikam Inc. or Contoso Ltd. as a vendor.\n\nNo document shows:\n\n- “VAT number”\n- “VAT ID”\n- “Vendor Tax ID”\n- “Vendor VAT ID”\n- Or any tax identifier explicitly tied to a vendor on an invoice.\n\nThus, there is **no explicit vendor VAT / Tax ID number** given in the provided materials.\n\nBecause the invoice itself is missing, and the only Tax ID present is a parcel/property tax ID, we cannot treat `0098765` as the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The original query assumes the existence of an **invoice** and asks for the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID on that invoice.\n- The provided evidence consists of **contracts and agreements**, not invoices.\n- The only Tax ID value (`Tax ID# 0098765`) is clearly a **parcel/property tax identifier** in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract [2][15], not a vendor VAT / Tax ID.\n- No party (Fabrikam Inc., Contoso Ltd., Walt Flood Realty, Contoso Lifts LLC) is shown with a VAT or tax ID number in these documents.\n\nTherefore, both sub-questions converge on the same issue: the necessary invoice and its vendor VAT / Tax ID are simply not present in the evidence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the documents provided, there is **no invoice** and **no vendor VAT / Tax ID number** shown. The only Tax ID present (`0098765`) is a **property Tax ID**, not a vendor VAT / Tax ID [2][15]. Consequently, the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice **cannot be determined from the available evidence**.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1: Who is the vendor listed on the invoice?\n\nAcross the provided documents, we see multiple contracts and agreements (Builders Limited Warranty, Holding Tank Servicing Contract, Property Management Agreement, Purchase Contract, Exhibit A – Scope of Work), but **none of these are invoices**. They identify parties such as:\n\n- Fabrikam Inc. and Contoso Ltd. in various roles (builder/buyer, pumper/owner, owner/agent, contractor/customer) [1][2][3][4].  \n\nHowever, there is **no document that is explicitly an invoice**, and none is labeled or formatted as such. Therefore, there is **no identifiable “vendor on the invoice”** in the supplied evidence.\n\nGiven that, Q1 cannot be answered from the evidence: we cannot reliably state who the vendor on the invoice is, because the invoice itself is not present.\n\n### Q2: What exact value is shown as the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice?\n\nThe only explicit “Tax ID” value in the corpus appears in the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, where the property’s **Tax ID# 0098765** is listed in the legal description section [2][15][19][24][37][50][67]. This is clearly labeled as a **property Tax ID**, not as a vendor VAT / Tax ID, and it is associated with the parcel, not with Fabrikam Inc. or Contoso Ltd. as a vendor.\n\nNo document shows:\n\n- “VAT number”\n- “VAT ID”\n- “Vendor Tax ID”\n- “Vendor VAT ID”\n- Or any tax identifier explicitly tied to a vendor on an invoice.\n\nThus, there is **no explicit vendor VAT / Tax ID number** given in the provided materials.\n\nBecause the invoice itself is missing, and the only Tax ID present is a parcel/property tax ID, we cannot treat `0098765` as the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The original query assumes the existence of an **invoice** and asks for the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID on that invoice.\n- The provided evidence consists of **contracts and agreements**, not invoices.\n- The only Tax ID value (`Tax ID# 0098765`) is clearly a **parcel/property tax identifier** in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract [2][15], not a vendor VAT / Tax ID.\n- No party (Fabrikam Inc., Contoso Ltd., Walt Flood Realty, Contoso Lifts LLC) is shown with a VAT or tax ID number in these documents.\n\nTherefore, both sub-questions converge on the same issue: the necessary invoice and its vendor VAT / Tax ID are simply not present in the evidence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the documents provided, there is **no invoice** and **no vendor VAT / Tax ID number** shown. The only Tax ID present (`0098765`) is a **property Tax ID**, not a vendor VAT / Tax ID [2][15]. Consequently, the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice **cannot be determined from the available evidence**.",
