The day-based windows here are:\n   - Warranty period for certain items: **sixty (60) days** for doors, windows, switches, etc.[12][13]\n   - Termination of warranty: claims must be made within **one (1) year or sixty (60) days**, as applicable, after commencement; any claims not made in writing within that period are not covered.[3][4]\n   - Exclusion: any claims not made in writing prior to the **one (1) year or sixty (60) day** warranty period are excluded.[3][4]\n   - Repairs: Builder will repair or replace covered defects within **sixty (60) days** of receiving the written report (longer if delayed by conditions).[1][3][4]\n   - Arbitration demand timing: arbitration may be demanded \u201cbefore the institution of any judicial proceeding or **not more than 60 days** after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross\u2011claim, counterclaim, answer, or amendment.\u201d[1]\n\n2. **Purchase Contract (Contoso Lifts)**\n   - Right to cancel: Customer may cancel within **3 business days** for a full refund; after that, the deposit is forfeited.[2][6]\n\n3. **Property Management Agreement**\n   - Termination notice: Either party may terminate the agreement upon **sixty (60) days written notice**.[5]\n   - Owner sale/listing notice: Owner must provide written notification to Agent within **five (5) business days** of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.[5]\n\n4. **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n   - Change filing deadline: In the event of a change in the contract, the owner must file a copy of the changes or new contract with the municipality and County within **ten (10) business days** from the date of change.[14]\n\nThese are all the explicit day-based windows; other timeframes expressed in weeks, months, or years (e.g., \u201c8\u201310 weeks,\u201d \u201ctwelve months,\u201d \u201c180 days\u201d) are not the focus unless explicitly in days, and 180 days is already in days but is about lease length, not a procedural window. The question is about \u201ctime windows,\u201d so I focus on procedural/obligation windows.\n\n---\n\n### Q2 \u2013 Sequencing and strictness of these day-based windows\n\nHere we look at what comes first/after and how strict each window is (e.g., \u201cwithin X days,\u201d \u201cnot more than X days\u201d).\n\n#### Builders Limited Warranty\n\n1. **60\u2011day warranty coverage for certain items**  \n   - Starts at commencement of the warranty term (date of final settlement or first occupancy, whichever comes first).[3][4][12][13]  \n   - Strictness: The coverage **terminates** after **sixty (60) days** for those items.[3][4][12][13]  \n   - Sequencing: This 60\u2011day window is a subset of the overall warranty term; it begins at commencement and ends 60 days later.\n\n2. **Claim filing deadline \u2013 1 year or 60 days**  \n   - \u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING \u2026 WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE \u2026 ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d[3][4]  \n   - Strictness: This is a **hard outer limit** (\u201cwithin\u201d and \u201cnot \u2026 are not covered\u201d) \u2013 effectively \u201cno more than 60 days\u201d for the short items and \u201cno more than 1 year\u201d for others.  \n   - Sequencing: The claim must be made **before** the end of the applicable warranty period (60 days or 1 year). This follows the commencement of the warranty and precedes any repair obligation.\n\n3. **Repair completion window \u2013 60 days**  \n   - After the Builder receives the written report of a covered defect, it will repair or replace \u201cwithin **sixty (60) days** (longer if weather, labor, or materials cause delays).\u201d[1][3][4]  \n   - Strictness: Nominally \u201cwithin 60 days,\u201d but explicitly **softened** by the clause allowing a longer period for specified delays.  \n   - Sequencing: This window **starts after** the Buyer/Owner submits a written defect report and runs forward 60 days (subject to extension).\n\n4. **Arbitration demand window \u2013 not more than 60 days after service**  \n   - A party may demand arbitration \u201cbefore the institution of any judicial proceeding or **not more than 60 days** after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross\u2011claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.\u201d[1]  \n   - Strictness: This is a **strict upper bound** (\u201cnot more than 60 days\u201d).  \n   - Sequencing: Triggered by service of a pleading; the 60\u2011day window follows that service and is the period during which arbitration can be demanded.\n\n#### Purchase Contract\n\n5. **3 business\u2011day cancellation window**  \n   - \u201cCustomer may cancel within **3 business days** for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d[2][6]  \n   - Strictness: Strict \u201cno more than 3 business days\u201d window; after that, the consequence (forfeiture) applies.  \n   - Sequencing: Starts at contract effectiveness (mutual signature and initial payment)[2][6] and ends 3 business days later; cancellation must occur within that window.\n\n#### Property Management Agreement\n\n6. **60\u2011day termination notice**  \n   - Either party may terminate the agreement \u201cupon **sixty (60) days written notice**.\u201d[5]  \n   - Strictness: This is a **minimum lead time** requirement \u2013 effectively \u201cat least 60 days before termination.\u201d  \n   - Sequencing: Notice is given first; termination takes effect **after** the 60\u2011day notice period.\n\n7. **5 business\u2011day owner listing notice**  \n   - Owner must provide Agent with written notification \u201cwithin **five (5) business days** of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.\u201d[5]  \n   - Strictness: Strict \u201cno more than 5 business days after the listing agreement\u201d to notify.  \n   - Sequencing: Listing agreement occurs first; notification must follow within 5 business days.\n\n#### Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\n8. **10 business\u2011day filing window for contract changes**  \n   - Owner must file a copy of any changes or a new service contract \u201cwithin **ten (10) business days** from the date of change to this service contract.\u201d[14]  \n   - Strictness: Strict \u201cno more than 10 business days after the change\u201d to file.  \n   - Sequencing: Change to the contract occurs first; filing must follow within 10 business days.\n\n---\n\n### Q3 \u2013 Explicit day-based windows, numerical values, and associated events/conditions\n\nSummarizing each explicit day-based window with its numeric value and associated event/condition:\n\n1. **60 days \u2013 warranty coverage for certain items**  \n   - Value: **60 days**  \n   - Event/condition: Period during which specified items (doors, windows, switches, etc.) are warranted to be free of defects.[12][13]  \n   - Context: Starts at warranty commencement (settlement/occupancy).[3][4]\n\n2. **60 days \u2013 claim filing limit for short warranty items**  \n   - Value: **60 days**  \n   - Event/condition: Claims for those items must be made in writing within 60 days of commencement; otherwise, not covered.[3][4]\n\n3. **60 days \u2013 repair completion target**  \n   - Value: **60 days**  \n   - Event/condition: Builder will repair or replace covered defects within 60 days of receiving the written report, subject to extension for specified delays.[1][3][4]\n\n4. **60 days \u2013 arbitration demand window**  \n   - Value: **60 days**  \n   - Event/condition: Arbitration may be demanded not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross\u2011claim, counterclaim, answer, or amendment.[1]\n\n5. **3 business days \u2013 cancellation right (purchase contract)**  \n   - Value: **3 business days**  \n   - Event/condition: Customer may cancel the purchase contract within 3 business days for a full refund; after that, deposit is forfeited.[2][6]\n\n6. **60 days \u2013 termination notice (property management)**  \n   - Value: **60 days**  \n   - Event/condition: Either party may terminate the property management agreement upon 60 days written notice.[5]\n\n7. **5 business days \u2013 owner listing notice**  \n   - Value: **5 business days**  \n   - Event/condition: Owner must notify Agent in writing within 5 business days of entering into a listing agreement to sell the property.[5]\n\n8. **10 business days \u2013 filing changes to holding tank contract**  \n   - Value: **10 business days**  \n   - Event/condition: Owner must file changes or a new service contract with the municipality and County within 10 business days from the date of change.[14]\n\n---\n\n### Q4 \u2013 (Implied) How these windows relate within each document, still focusing on day-based windows\n\nWithin each document, the day-based windows form internal timing structures:\n\n#### Builders Limited Warranty\n\n- **Start point**: Warranty begins at final settlement or first occupancy, whichever comes first.[3][4]\n- **Short coverage window**: For certain items, coverage lasts **60 days** from that start.[12][13]\n- **Claim deadline**: Claims must be made in writing **within that 60\u2011day period** (for short items) or within 1 year for others.[3][4]\n- **Post-claim repair window**: Once a claim is made, Builder has **60 days** (subject to extension) to complete repairs.[1][3][4]\n- **Dispute escalation**: If disputes arise and litigation is initiated, a party has **up to 60 days after service** of pleadings to demand arbitration.[1]\n\nSo, the sequence is: commencement \u2192 (up to 60 days) coverage and claim window for certain items \u2192 claim filed \u2192 (up to 60 days) repair window \u2192 potential dispute \u2192 (up to 60 days after service) arbitration demand.\n\n#### Purchase Contract\n\n- **Contract effective** upon mutual signature and initial payment.[2][6]\n- **Cancellation window**: From that effective date, the Customer has **3 business days** to cancel for a full refund; after that, the deposit is forfeited.[2][6]\n\nSequence: contract effective \u2192 (within 3 business days) optional cancellation \u2192 after 3 business days, deposit becomes non\u2011refundable.\n\n#### Property Management Agreement\n\n- **Agreement term** begins on a specified date and renews annually.[5]\n- **Termination**: Either party can end the agreement by giving **60 days written notice**; termination occurs after that notice period.[5]\n- **Listing notice**: If the Owner lists the property for sale, they must notify the Agent within **5 business days** of the listing agreement.[5]\n\nSequence: listing agreement \u2192 (within 5 business days) owner notifies Agent; separately, if either party wants to end the management relationship, they must give notice at least 60 days before the desired termination date.\n\n#### Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\n- **Contract in effect** until terminated by owner or pumper.[14]\n- **Change filing**: If the contract is changed, the owner must file the updated contract within **10 business days** of the change.[14]\n\nSequence: change to contract \u2192 (within 10 business days) filing with municipality and County.\n\n---\n\n### Q5 \u2013 How strictness constraints combine into overall timing rules\n\nLooking at strictness (\u201cwithin,\u201d \u201cnot more than,\u201d \u201cupon X days\u2019 notice\u201d) and how they interact:\n\n#### Builders Limited Warranty\n\n- **Coverage and claim windows** are **hard outer limits**:\n  - Coverage for certain items ends after **60 days**; claims not made in writing within that period are not covered.[3][4][12][13]\n  - This creates a combined rule: to be covered, a defect in those items must both arise and be claimed within the 60\u2011day window.\n- **Repair window** is **soft**:\n  - Builder aims to complete repairs within **60 days**, but may exceed this if weather, labor, or material shortages cause delays.[1][3][4]\n  - So the obligation is \u201cwithin 60 days unless justified delay,\u201d not an absolute deadline.\n- **Arbitration demand** is **strict**:\n  - \u201cNot more than 60 days after service\u201d sets a firm upper bound for demanding arbitration once litigation has begun.[1]\n- Combined effect: The warranty regime uses strict short windows for **claim eligibility** and **arbitration election**, but a more flexible window for **performance of repairs**.\n\n#### Purchase Contract\n\n- **3 business\u2011day cancellation** is a **strict, short window**:\n  - \u201cWithin 3 business days\u201d for full refund; \u201cafterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d[2][6]\n  - This creates a clear rule: the customer\u2019s risk of losing the deposit begins immediately after the 3\u2011business\u2011day window closes.\n\n#### Property Management Agreement\n\n- **60\u2011day termination notice** is a **minimum lead time**:\n  - \u201cUpon sixty (60) days written notice\u201d means termination cannot be effective sooner than 60 days after notice.[5]\n- **5 business\u2011day listing notice** is a **strict follow\u2011up window**:\n  - Owner must notify Agent within 5 business days of signing a listing agreement.[5]\n- Combined effect: The Agent is guaranteed timely information about a sale (within 5 business days) and a buffer period (60 days) before the management relationship can end, allowing the Agent to manage existing reservations and obligations.\n\n#### Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\n- **10 business\u2011day filing window** is a **strict follow\u2011up requirement**:\n  - Owner must file changes within 10 business days of the change.[14]\n- Combined effect: Any change in servicing arrangements must be promptly formalized with the municipality and County, ensuring regulatory continuity.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Common pattern of \u201cwithin X days\u201d**:  \n  - Claim filing (warranty) \u2013 within 60 days or 1 year.[3][4]  \n  - Cancellation (purchase contract) \u2013 within 3 business days.[2][6]  \n  - Owner listing notice \u2013 within 5 business days.[5]  \n  - Filing contract changes \u2013 within 10 business days.[14]  \n  These all function as **strict upper bounds**: actions must occur no later than the specified number of days after a triggering event.\n\n- **\u201cUpon X days\u2019 notice\u201d vs. \u201cnot more than X days\u201d**:  \n  - Termination notice (property management) uses \u201cupon 60 days written notice,\u201d which is effectively \u201cat least 60 days before termination.\u201d[5]  \n  - Arbitration demand uses \u201cnot more than 60 days after service,\u201d a strict upper limit.[1]  \n  Together, they show two directions of constraint: one sets a **minimum lead time** before an event; the other sets a **maximum delay** after an event.\n\n- **Short vs. long windows**:  \n  - Very short windows (3, 5, 10 business days) govern **consumer protection and disclosure/filing** (cancellation, listing notice, regulatory filing).[2][5][6][14]  \n  - Medium windows (60 days) govern **warranty coverage, repair performance, dispute escalation, and contract termination**.[1][3][4][5][12][13]\n\n- **Sequencing across obligations**:  \n  - In the warranty, the 60\u2011day coverage/claim window precedes the 60\u2011day repair window, which in turn may precede a 60\u2011day arbitration demand window if disputes escalate.[1][3][4][12][13]  \n  - In the property management agreement, the 5\u2011day listing notice and 60\u2011day termination notice operate in parallel but at different stages: one immediately after a listing, the other before ending the relationship.[5]\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the corpus, the explicit day-based time windows and their associated events/conditions are:\n\n- **60 days** \u2013 warranty coverage and claim window for certain home components; claims must be made in writing within this period.[3][4][12][13]\n- **60 days** \u2013 target period for the Builder to complete repairs after receiving a written defect report, subject to extension for specified delays.[1][3][4]\n- **60 days** \u2013 maximum time after service of pleadings to demand arbitration in the Builders Limited Warranty.[1]\n- **3 business days** \u2013 customer\u2019s right to cancel the lift purchase contract for a full refund; after this, the deposit is forfeited.[2][6]\n- **60 days** \u2013 minimum written notice required to terminate the property management agreement.[5]\n- **5 business days** \u2013 maximum time for the Owner to notify the Agent after entering a listing agreement to sell the property.[5]\n- **10 business days** \u2013 maximum time for the Owner to file changes or a new holding tank service contract with the municipality and County after a change.[14]\n\nThese windows collectively define strict or semi\u2011strict timing rules around claims, repairs, cancellations, notices, and regulatory filings, using \u201cwithin X days,\u201d \u201cnot more than X days,\u201d and \u201cupon X days\u2019 notice\u201d to control when parties must act and when rights or obligations begin or end.",

the window runs from the time the contract is entered into.[2][6]\n\n- **Property Management Agreement**\n  - 12\u2011month initial term: triggered by the specified start date \u201c2010-06-15.\u201d[5]  \n  - 60\u2011day termination notice: triggered by a party\u2019s decision to terminate; the notice must be given at least 60 days before termination.[5]  \n  - 5\u2011business\u2011day listing notice: triggered by the Owner entering into a listing agreement to sell the property.[5]  \n  - 180\u2011day thresholds: triggered by the length of each reservation or lease (less than or more than 180 days).[5][7][8]\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n  - 10\u2011business\u2011day filing window: triggered by \u201cthe date of change to this service contract.\u201d[14]\n\n---\n\n### Q6: Patterns and inconsistencies across the set\n\n**Patterns:**\n\n1. **Use of dual short and long warranty periods**  \n   - Builders Limited Warranty uses a one\u2011year period for major systems and a 60\u2011day period for more minor components.[12]  \n   - The purchase contract uses a 90\u2011day labor warranty, which is shorter than the one\u2011year structural warranty but longer than the 60\u2011day minor\u2011item warranty, reflecting a graded approach to risk and cost.[2][6]\n\n2. **Consistent linkage of deadlines to clear triggering events**  \n   - Most timeframes are explicitly tied to a specific event: settlement/occupancy, filing of a Dispute, service of a complaint, execution of a contract, entering a listing agreement, or the date of change to a contract.[3][4][1][9][10][11][2][6][5][14]  \n   - This reduces ambiguity about when the clock starts.\n\n3. **Use of \u201cbusiness days\u201d for notice and cancellation obligations**  \n   - The 3\u2011day cancellation right, 5\u2011day listing notice, and 10\u2011day filing requirement are all expressed in \u201cbusiness days,\u201d reflecting an intent to exclude weekends/holidays for administrative tasks.[2][6][5][14]\n\n4. **180\u2011day thresholds as a meaningful boundary**  \n   - 180 days is used both as:\n     - A classification boundary between short\u2011term and long\u2011term rentals.[5][7][8]  \n     - A target maximum duration for arbitration proceedings.[9][10][11]  \n   - In both contexts, 180 days marks a significant dividing line between \u201cshort\u201d and \u201clong\u201d processes or commitments.\n\n5. **60\u2011day windows as a recurring standard**  \n   - 60 days appears repeatedly:\n     - Warranty coverage for certain items.[12]  \n     - Warranty termination and claim deadlines.[3][4][6]  \n     - Builder\u2019s repair performance window.[7]  \n     - Arbitration demand window after service of pleadings.[1]  \n   - This suggests 60 days is treated as a reasonable standard period for both performance and procedural steps.\n\n**Inconsistencies or variations:**\n\n1. **Different treatment of similar concepts across documents**\n   - Warranty periods:\n     - Builders Limited Warranty: 1 year / 60 days.[12]  \n     - Purchase contract: 90 days for labor only.[2][6]  \n   - There is no harmonized standard; each contract sets its own durations based on context.\n\n2. **Mix of \u201ccalendar days\u201d vs \u201cbusiness days\u201d without explicit clarification**\n   - Some periods are clearly \u201cbusiness days\u201d (3, 5, 10 business days).[2][6][5][14]  \n   - Others are just \u201cdays\u201d (60 days, 90 days, 180 days, one year) and are typically interpreted as calendar days, but this is not explicitly stated. This could create interpretive issues if disputes arise.\n\n3. **Different levels of precision in start events**\n   - Builders Limited Warranty explicitly defines commencement (\u201cdate of final settlement or \u2026 first occupies the home, whichever comes first\u201d).[3][4]  \n   - The 90\u2011day labor warranty in the purchase contract does not explicitly state the start date (completion is implied but not spelled out).[2][6]  \n   - The 3\u2011day cancellation period also does not explicitly say \u201cfrom the date of signing,\u201d though that is strongly implied.[2][6]\n\n4. **Arbitration timing: aspirational vs mandatory**\n   - The 180\u2011day arbitration conclusion period is framed as \u201cto the maximum extent practicable,\u201d and the arbitrator can impose sanctions for delay.[9][10][11]  \n   - By contrast, the 60\u2011day window to demand arbitration after service of pleadings is a hard outer limit (\u201cnot more than 60 days after service\u2026\u201d).[1]  \n   - This mix of mandatory and aspirational timing standards may lead to different expectations about enforceability.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The original query asks to \u201ccompare \u2018time windows\u2019 across the set\u201d and \u201clist all explicit day-based timeframes.\u201d  \n  - Q1 and Q3 identify and quote each day-based timeframe and tie it to its specific obligation, event, or condition.[12][3][4][6][7][1][9][10][11][2][5][7][8][14]  \n  - Q4 clarifies the precise triggering events that start each window, which is essential for understanding and comparing how these windows operate in practice.[3][4][7][1][9][10][11][2][5][14]  \n  - Q2 and Q5 compare the windows by length, triggers, and purposes, showing how they differ and how they are used (warranty coverage, notice obligations, dispute resolution, contract duration, regulatory compliance).[12][3][4][6][7][1][9][10][11][2][5][7][8][14]  \n  - Q6 synthesizes patterns and inconsistencies, revealing recurring standards (60\u2011day windows, 180\u2011day thresholds, business\u2011day usage) and variations (different warranty lengths, mixed clarity on start dates and calendar vs business days).[12][3][4][6][7][1][9][10][11][2][5][7][8][14]\n\nTogether, these steps fully address the original query by both cataloging all explicit day-based timeframes and analyzing how they function and relate across the documents.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the corpus, the explicit day-based time windows include:\n\n- **Warranty and performance periods:** one (1) year and sixty (60) days for different categories of home components in the Builders Limited Warranty, with matching claim deadlines and a 60\u2011day repair window; a 90\u2011day labor warranty in the lift purchase contract.[12][3][4][6][7][2]\n- **Consumer rights:** a 3\u2011business\u2011day cancellation period for a full refund in the purchase contract.[2][6]\n- **Contract terms and notices:** a 12\u2011month initial term and successive one\u2011year renewals, a 60\u2011day termination notice, and a 5\u2011business\u2011day listing notice in the property management agreement.[5]\n- **Classification thresholds:** 180\u2011day boundaries distinguishing short\u2011term vs long\u2011term rentals.[5][7][8]\n- **Regulatory/compliance deadlines:** a 10\u2011business\u2011day window to file changes to the holding tank service contract with authorities.[14]\n- **Dispute resolution timing:** a 60\u2011day outer limit to demand arbitration after service of pleadings and a 180\u2011day target to conclude arbitration after filing a Dispute.[1][9][10][11]\n\nThese windows vary in length from a few business days to a year, are generally tied to clear triggering events (such as settlement, occupancy, contract execution, filing or service of legal documents, or changes to a contract), and serve distinct purposes: protecting consumers, defining warranty scope, structuring contractual relationships, ensuring regulatory compliance, and managing dispute resolution timelines.[12][3][4][6][7][1][9][10][11][2][5][7][8][14]",
