  "response": "## Analysis\n\nBelow, I walk through the inconsistencies in the **Contoso Lifts LLC invoice** by following the logical flow of the sub\u2011questions and comparing the invoice to the **Purchase Contract** and its **Exhibit A \u2013 Scope of Work**.\n\n---\n\n### Q1 & Q4 \u2013 All areas of inconsistency in the invoice, with evidence (goods/services, billing logistics, admin/legal)\n\n#### 1. Product model inconsistency\n\n- **Invoice**: Lists \u201cVertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)\u201d as the lift being sold. [10]  \n- **Contract / Scope of Work**: Specifies \u201c1 Vertical Platform Lift (AscendPro VPX200)\u201d as the required lift model. [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**: The model name on the invoice (Savaria V1504) does not match the model specified in the contract (AscendPro VPX200). This is a substantive inconsistency in the goods sold.  \n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice description: \u201cVertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)\u201d [10]  \n- Contract scope: \u201c1 Vertical Platform Lift (AscendPro VPX200)\u201d [13], [14]  \n- Exhibit A scope: also \u201c1 Vertical Platform Lift (AscendPro VPX200)\u201d [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Door specification inconsistency\n\n- **Invoice**: \u201c80\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts, WR-500 lock, automatic door operator\u201d [10]  \n- **Contract / Scope of Work**: \u201c1 Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- The invoice adds specific features not mentioned in the contract:  \n  - \u201c80\" High\u201d  \n  - \u201clow profile\u201d  \n  - \u201cWR-500 lock\u201d  \n- The contract only commits to an \u201cAluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener\u201d without those extra attributes. [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\nThis may indicate:\n- Either an **unapproved upgrade** (if not separately agreed in writing), or  \n- A **documentation mismatch** where the contract was not updated to reflect the actual door configuration.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice door line item: \u201c80\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts, WR-500 lock, automatic door operator\u201d [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201c1 Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Hall call station specification inconsistency\n\n- **Invoice**: \u201c2 Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing\u201d [10]  \n- **Contract / Scope of Work**: \u201c2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- The contract explicitly requires **flush\u2011mount** hall call stations. [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- The invoice omits \u201cflush\u2011mount\u201d and only says \u201cHall Call stations,\u201d which could imply a different (possibly surface\u2011mount) product. [10]\n\nThis is a **specification gap**: the invoice does not confirm that the hall call stations meet the flush\u2011mount requirement.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201c2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- Invoice: \u201c2 Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing\u201d [10]\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Cab description wording inconsistency (minor but notable)\n\n- **Invoice**: \u201cSpecial Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3\u201d [10]  \n- **Contract / Scope of Work**: \u201c1 Custom cab 42\" x 62\" with Type 3 90-degree access\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- The contract describes a \u201cCustom cab 42\" x 62\" with Type 3 90-degree access\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17].  \n- The invoice describes \u201cSpecial Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3\u201d [10].\n\nThe dimensions and \u201cType 3 / 90\u2011degree\u201d concept match, but the terminology differs (\u201cCustom cab\u201d vs. \u201cSpecial Size cab\u201d). This is likely a **terminology inconsistency** rather than a substantive change, but it could create ambiguity if \u201cspecial size\u201d implies a non\u2011standard configuration beyond what was agreed.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201cCustom cab 42\" x 62\" with Type 3 90-degree access\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- Invoice: \u201cSpecial Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3\u201d [10]\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Power system description alignment (no inconsistency)\n\n- **Invoice**: \u201c110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts\u201d [10]  \n- **Contract / Scope of Work**: \u201c1 Power system: 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\nThis line item **matches** the contract description; no inconsistency is identified here.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice: \u201c110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts\u201d [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201c1 Power system: 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n#### 6. Outdoor configuration alignment (no inconsistency)\n\n- **Invoice**: \u201cOutdoor fitting\u201d [10]  \n- **Contract / Scope of Work**: \u201c1 Outdoor configuration package\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\nThe wording differs slightly (\u201cfitting\u201d vs. \u201cconfiguration package\u201d), but both clearly refer to an outdoor configuration. No clear inconsistency, though the invoice is less specific.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice: \u201cOutdoor fitting\u201d [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201c1 Outdoor configuration package\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n#### 7. Price and payment\u2011terms inconsistency\n\n- **Invoice total**:  \n  - Subtotal: $29,900.00 [10]  \n  - Tax: N/A [10]  \n  - Total: $29,900.00 [10]  \n  - Amount Due: $29,900.00 [10]\n\n- **Contract total and payment schedule**:  \n  - \u201cTotal contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:\u201d [13], [14]  \n    - \u201c$20,000.00 upon signing\u201d [13], [14]  \n    - \u201c$7,000.00 upon delivery\u201d [13], [14]  \n    - \u201c$2,900.00 upon completion\u201d [13], [14]\n\n- **Invoice comment**: \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d [10]  \n- **Invoice terms**: \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d [10]\n\n**Inconsistencies**:\n\n1. **Amount due vs. \u201cinitial payment\u201d**  \n   - The invoice states \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d [10], which implies this invoice should cover only the **first installment** ($20,000.00) under the contract. [13], [14]  \n   - However, the \u201cAMOUNT DUE\u201d on the invoice is the **full contract price** of $29,900.00. [10], [13], [14]  \n   - This conflicts with the contract\u2019s three\u2011installment structure and the \u201cinitial payment\u201d label.\n\n2. **Terms vs. contract schedule**  \n   - Invoice terms: \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d [10].  \n   - Contract: only the **first** $20,000.00 is due upon signing; the remaining $9,900.00 is due later (delivery and completion). [13], [14]  \n   - The invoice effectively accelerates all payments to the signing date, which is inconsistent with the agreed payment terms.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice totals and terms: subtotal, tax N/A, total, amount due, \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d [10]  \n- Contract payment terms: total $29,900.00, three installments with specific milestones [13], [14]\n\n---\n\n#### 8. Tax treatment ambiguity\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - \u201cTAX: N/A\u201d [10]  \n- **Contract**:  \n  - States total contract price $29,900.00 but does not explicitly break out or mention sales tax. [13], [14]\n\n**Potential inconsistency / ambiguity**:\n- The invoice explicitly states \u201cTAX: N/A\u201d [10], which could mean:\n  - Tax is not applicable, or  \n  - Tax is included in the price, or  \n  - Tax is being omitted contrary to applicable law.\n- The contract is silent on tax treatment. [13], [14]\n\nWithout a governing tax clause, this is more an **ambiguity** than a proven inconsistency, but it is a **billing logistics issue** that could conflict with legal tax obligations.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice: \u201cTAX: N/A\u201d [10]  \n- Contract: total price stated, no tax breakdown [13], [14]\n\n---\n\n#### 9. Administrative / legal party\u2011name inconsistency\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Customer name: \u201cJohn Doe / Fabrikam Construction\u201d [10]  \n  - Address: 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155 [10]\n\n- **Contract**:  \n  - Customer: \u201cFabrikam Inc. (Customer), located at 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155.\u201d [13], [14]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- The contract is between **Contoso Lifts LLC** and **Fabrikam Inc.** [13], [14].  \n- The invoice is addressed to **John Doe / Fabrikam Construction** at the same address. [10]  \n- \u201cFabrikam Construction\u201d is not the exact legal entity named in the contract (\u201cFabrikam Inc.\u201d). [13], [14]  \n- This creates a **legal/administrative inconsistency** about who is the contracting customer vs. who is being billed.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice \u201cTO\u201d and \u201cSHIP TO\u201d: \u201cJohn Doe / Fabrikam Construction\u201d at 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155 [10]  \n- Contract parties: \u201cContoso Lifts LLC. (Contractor)\u2026 and Fabrikam Inc. (Customer)\u2026 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155\u201d [13], [14]\n\n---\n\n#### 10. Job / project identity inconsistency\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - No explicit job name or project reference; only \u201cCOMMENTS: Initial payment in accordance with contract\u201d and P.O. Number \u201c30060204.\u201d [10]\n\n- **Contract / Exhibit A**:  \n  - Job Name: \u201cBayfront Animal Clinic\u201d [16], [17]  \n  - Job Location: \u201c811 Ocean Drive, Suite 405, Tampa, FL 33602\u201d [16], [17]  \n  - Customer: Fabrikam Inc. at 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155 [13], [14]\n\n**Inconsistency / gap**:\n- The invoice does not reference \u201cBayfront Animal Clinic\u201d or the Tampa job location. [10], [16], [17]  \n- It only references the customer\u2019s corporate address in Dayton, FL. [10], [13], [14]  \n- This is an **administrative inconsistency**: the invoice is not clearly tied to the specific project defined in Exhibit A, which could cause confusion about which contract or job the invoice relates to.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice: no job name or project location; only customer address and P.O. number [10]  \n- Exhibit A: job name and Tampa job location [16], [17]  \n- Contract: customer corporate address in Dayton [13], [14]\n\n---\n\n### Q2 & Q5 \u2013 Line\u2011item inconsistencies in goods/services (with detailed specs and evidence)\n\nHere is a line\u2011by\u2011line comparison of the invoice against the contract/Exhibit A.\n\n#### Line Item 1 \u2013 Vertical Platform Lift\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Quantity: 1  \n  - Description: \u201cVertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)\u201d [10]  \n  - Unit Price: 11,200.00 [10]  \n  - Total: 11,200.00 [10]\n\n- **Contract / Exhibit A**:  \n  - \u201c1 Vertical Platform Lift (AscendPro VPX200)\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n  - No per\u2011item price breakdown; only total contract price $29,900.00. [13], [14]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- Model mismatch: Savaria V1504 vs. AscendPro VPX200. [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- No evidence that the model change was approved via a written change order (contract requires changes to be agreed in writing). [13], [14]\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice model: \u201cSavaria V1504\u201d [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A model: \u201cAscendPro VPX200\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- Contract changes clause: \u201cAny changes must be agreed to in writing\u2026\u201d [13], [14]\n\n---\n\n#### Line Item 2 \u2013 Power system\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Quantity: 1  \n  - Description: \u201c110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts\u201d [10]  \n  - Unit Price: 3,000.00 [10]  \n  - Total: 3,000.00 [10]\n\n- **Contract / Exhibit A**:  \n  - \u201c1 Power system: 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- None in the technical specification; description matches.  \n- The contract does not specify a separate price, so the unit price cannot be directly validated, but there is no explicit conflict.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice: \u201c110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts\u201d [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201c1 Power system: 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n#### Line Item 3 \u2013 Cab\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Quantity: 1  \n  - Description: \u201cSpecial Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3\u201d [10]  \n  - Unit Price: 5,800.00 [10]  \n  - Total: 5,800.00 [10]\n\n- **Contract / Exhibit A**:  \n  - \u201c1 Custom cab 42\" x 62\" with Type 3 90-degree access\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- Wording difference (\u201cSpecial Size\u201d vs. \u201cCustom cab\u201d), but dimensions and Type 3 90\u2011degree access match. [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- Likely a minor terminology inconsistency; no clear evidence of a different product.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice: \u201cSpecial Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3\u201d [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201cCustom cab 42\" x 62\" with Type 3 90-degree access\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n#### Line Item 4 \u2013 Outdoor configuration\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Quantity: 1  \n  - Description: \u201cOutdoor fitting\u201d [10]  \n  - Unit Price: 2,000.00 [10]  \n  - Total: 2,000.00 [10]\n\n- **Contract / Exhibit A**:  \n  - \u201c1 Outdoor configuration package\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- Terminology difference only (\u201cfitting\u201d vs. \u201cconfiguration package\u201d). [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- No clear substantive inconsistency, but the invoice is less descriptive.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice: \u201cOutdoor fitting\u201d [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201cOutdoor configuration package\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n#### Line Item 5 \u2013 Door\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Quantity: 1  \n  - Description: \u201c80\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts, WR-500 lock, automatic door operator\u201d [10]  \n  - Unit Price: 5,000.00 [10]  \n  - Total: 5,000.00 [10]\n\n- **Contract / Exhibit A**:  \n  - \u201c1 Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- Invoice adds:  \n  - \u201c80\" High\u201d  \n  - \u201clow profile\u201d  \n  - \u201cWR-500 lock\u201d [10]  \n- Contract does not mention height, profile, or lock model. [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- This could be:\n  - An **unpriced upgrade** or change not documented in the contract, or  \n  - A more detailed description of the same door, but without explicit contractual backing.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice door description: includes 80\" height, low profile, WR\u2011500 lock [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: generic \u201cAluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- Contract changes clause: written agreement required for changes [13], [14]\n\n---\n\n#### Line Item 6 \u2013 Hall call stations\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Quantity: 2  \n  - Description: \u201cHall Call stations for bottom and upper landing\u201d [10]  \n  - Unit Price: 1,450.00 [10]  \n  - Total: 2,900.00 [10]\n\n- **Contract / Exhibit A**:  \n  - \u201c2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- Contract requires **flush\u2011mount** stations. [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- Invoice omits \u201cflush\u2011mount,\u201d leaving the mounting type unspecified. [10]  \n- This is a **specification inconsistency**: the invoice does not confirm compliance with the flush\u2011mount requirement.\n\n**Evidence**:  \n- Invoice: \u201cHall Call stations for bottom and upper landing\u201d [10]  \n- Contract/Exhibit A: \u201c2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)\u201d [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n#### Totals, discounts, taxes\n\n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Subtotal: 29,900.00 [10]  \n  - Discounts: none listed [10]  \n  - Tax: N/A [10]  \n  - Total: 29,900.00 [10]  \n  - Amount Due: 29,900.00 [10]\n\n- **Contract**:  \n  - Total contract price: 29,900.00 [13], [14]  \n  - No explicit discounts or tax breakdown. [13], [14]\n\n**Inconsistency**:\n- The **amount** matches the contract total, but the **timing** and **labeling** (as \u201cInitial payment\u201d yet equal to full contract price) conflict with the installment structure, as discussed above. [10], [13], [14]\n\n---\n\n### Q3 & Q6 \u2013 Evidence supporting relationships between inconsistencies\n\nThe inconsistencies are interrelated:\n\n1. **Model and specification changes vs. change\u2011order requirement**  \n   - The contract requires that \u201cAny changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone.\u201d [13], [14]  \n   - The invoice shows a different lift model (Savaria V1504) [10] and additional door features (80\" high, low profile, WR\u2011500 lock) [10] that are not in the contract/Exhibit A. [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n   - There is no evidence of a written change order in the provided documents, so these product differences are inconsistent with the contract\u2019s change\u2011management clause.\n\n2. **Payment\u2011term inconsistency tied to \u201cinitial payment\u201d language**  \n   - The contract\u2019s three\u2011installment schedule [13], [14] is contradicted by the invoice demanding the full $29,900.00 \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d while calling it \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract.\u201d [10]  \n   - This links the **billing logistics inconsistency** directly to the contract\u2019s payment\u2011terms clause.\n\n3. **Party\u2011name and project\u2011identity inconsistencies affecting enforceability**  \n   - Contract party: Fabrikam Inc. [13], [14]  \n   - Invoice addressee: John Doe / Fabrikam Construction [10]  \n   - Exhibit A job: Bayfront Animal Clinic in Tampa [16], [17]  \n   - Invoice: no job name, only the corporate address in Dayton [10]  \n   - These discrepancies collectively create uncertainty about which entity and which project the invoice is enforcing, tying together the administrative/legal inconsistencies.\n\n**Evidence linking these relationships**:  \n- Change clause: \u201cAny changes must be agreed to in writing\u2026\u201d [13], [14]  \n- Model and door differences: [10] vs. [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- Payment terms vs. invoice terms: [10] vs. [13], [14]  \n- Party names and addresses: [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Goods vs. Contract**:  \n  - The **lift model** and **door details** on the invoice differ from the contract/Exhibit A, and the **hall call stations** are underspecified relative to the \u201cflush\u2011mount\u201d requirement. [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n  - These are not isolated; they directly conflict with the contract\u2019s requirement that changes be agreed in writing. [13], [14]\n\n- **Billing vs. Contract**:  \n  - The invoice\u2019s \u201cInitial payment\u201d label and \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d term conflict with the contract\u2019s three\u2011installment schedule, even though the total amount matches. [10], [13], [14]  \n  - This ties the **billing logistics inconsistency** to the contract\u2019s payment\u2011terms clause.\n\n- **Administrative / Legal Alignment**:  \n  - The mismatch between **Fabrikam Inc.** (contract) and **John Doe / Fabrikam Construction** (invoice) [10], [13], [14], plus the lack of explicit job reference on the invoice vs. \u201cBayfront Animal Clinic\u201d in Exhibit A [16], [17], creates uncertainty about the legal relationship between the invoice and the contract.\n\nTogether, these show that the invoice is not fully aligned with the contract in **what is being sold**, **who is being billed**, and **how and when payment is due**.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOrganized by the structure requested in the original query:\n\n### (1) All inconsistencies with corresponding evidence\n\n1. **Lift model mismatch**: Invoice lists \u201cSavaria V1504\u201d vs. contract\u2019s \u201cAscendPro VPX200.\u201d [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n2. **Door specification mismatch**: Invoice adds 80\" height, low profile, WR\u2011500 lock not specified in contract. [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n3. **Hall call station spec gap**: Contract requires flush\u2011mount; invoice omits \u201cflush\u2011mount.\u201d [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n4. **Cab wording difference**: \u201cSpecial Size\u201d vs. \u201cCustom cab\u201d (minor, but noted). [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n5. **Payment\u2011terms conflict**: Invoice demands full $29,900.00 \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d and calls it \u201cInitial payment,\u201d conflicting with three\u2011installment schedule. [10], [13], [14]  \n6. **Tax ambiguity**: Invoice \u201cTAX: N/A\u201d vs. contract silence on tax; potential compliance issue. [10], [13], [14]  \n7. **Customer identity inconsistency**: Contract with Fabrikam Inc.; invoice to John Doe / Fabrikam Construction. [10], [13], [14]  \n8. **Project identity / reference gap**: Exhibit A job \u201cBayfront Animal Clinic\u201d in Tampa vs. invoice lacking job name and referencing only the Dayton address. [10], [16], [17]\n\n### (2) Inconsistencies in goods or services sold, by line item\n\n- **Lift line item**: Model mismatch (Savaria V1504 vs. AscendPro VPX200). [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- **Power system line item**: No inconsistency; matches contract. [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- **Cab line item**: Terminology difference (\u201cSpecial Size\u201d vs. \u201cCustom cab\u201d), but specs match. [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- **Outdoor configuration line item**: Wording difference only (\u201cOutdoor fitting\u201d vs. \u201cOutdoor configuration package\u201d). [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- **Door line item**: Additional features (80\" height, low profile, WR\u2011500 lock) not in contract. [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]  \n- **Hall call station line item**: Missing \u201cflush\u2011mount\u201d requirement from contract. [10], [13], [14], [16], [17]\n\n### (3) Inconsistencies regarding billing logistics and administrative/legal issues\n\n- **Billing logistics**:  \n  - Full contract amount invoiced as \u201cInitial payment\u201d and due at signing, contrary to three\u2011installment schedule. [10], [13], [14]  \n  - Tax marked \u201cN/A\u201d without contractual or legal explanation. [10], [13], [14]\n\n- **Administrative/legal**:  \n  - Contract party vs. invoice addressee mismatch (Fabrikam Inc. vs. John Doe / Fabrikam Construction). [10], [13], [14]  \n  - Invoice not clearly tied to the \u201cBayfront Animal Clinic\u201d project defined in Exhibit A. [10], [16], [17]\n\nThese are the complete, evidence\u2011backed areas of inconsistency between the invoice and the governing contract documents.",
