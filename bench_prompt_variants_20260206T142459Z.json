Under the \u201cTerm\u201d section, the warranty explicitly defines when coverage begins:\n\n> \u201cThe terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on **the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first**.\u201d\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011\u301019\u2020L2-L2\u3011\n\nSo, the coverage start (commencement) is triggered by the earlier of two events:\n\n1. The **date of final settlement** (i.e., closing/financial settlement of the home purchase), or  \n2. The **date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**.\n\nNo additional conditions (like registration or separate activation) are stated; the warranty automatically starts on whichever of those two events happens first\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n\n### Q2. What must happen before coverage ends, and how that relates to the start\n\nThe warranty describes two main sets of coverage durations and the conditions that end them:\n\n1. **Time\u2011based termination from the coverage start**\n\n   The same \u201cTerm\u201d section states:\n\n   > \u201cExcept as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate **one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**. ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011\u301019\u2020L2-L2\u3011\n\n   Combined with the coverage start rule, this means:\n\n   - For items covered by a **one\u2011year** warranty (e.g., structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical, roof)\u301010\u2020L1-L1\u3011\u301052\u2020L1-L1\u3011:\n     - Coverage begins on the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n     - Coverage ends **one year after that commencement date**, unless otherwise provided\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n   - For items covered by a **60\u2011day** warranty (e.g., doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, certain caulking)\u301010\u2020L1-L1\u3011\u301052\u2020L1-L1\u3011:\n     - Coverage begins on the same commencement date (earlier of final settlement or first occupancy)\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n     - Coverage ends **60 days after that commencement date**\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n\n   Additionally, for any claim to be covered, it must be:\n\n   - **Made in writing** and sent as specified (by certified mail, return receipt requested) **before the applicable 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day period expires**\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011\u301019\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n   - Claims not made in writing within those periods are \u201cnot covered,\u201d regardless of when the defect was discovered\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n\n   Thus, the time limits (1 year or 60 days) are measured from the defined coverage start (\u201ccommencement\u201d) and act as the primary end\u2011of\u2011coverage triggers.\n\n2. **Transfer/occupancy\u2011based termination**\n\n   The warranty also includes a separate termination condition based on ownership/occupancy:\n\n   > \u201cThis limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is **not transferable**. In the event the first purchaser **sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates**.\u201d\u301010\u2020L8-L8\u3011\u301019\u2020L8-L8\u3011\n\n   This creates additional end\u2011of\u2011coverage triggers that can occur **before** the 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day time limits:\n\n   - If the **first purchaser sells the home**, coverage ends automatically on that sale\u301010\u2020L8-L8\u3011.\n   - If the **first purchaser moves out** (even without selling), coverage also ends automatically\u301010\u2020L8-L8\u3011.\n\n   These events are tied back to the original coverage start in that the warranty is only ever in force for the **first purchaser** from the commencement date until the earlier of:\n   - The applicable time limit (1 year or 60 days after commencement), or  \n   - The first purchaser\u2019s sale of the home or move\u2011out\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011\u301010\u2020L8-L8\u3011.\n\n3. **Procedural conditions that effectively limit coverage**\n\n   While not separate \u201cend dates,\u201d the warranty imposes procedural requirements that function as conditions on coverage:\n\n   - **Written notice requirement**: The Buyer/Owner must send a written description of the defect by certified mail to the Builder **before the 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day period ends**\u301010\u2020L6-L6\u3011\u301019\u2020L6-L6\u3011. Failure to do so means the claim is \u201cnot covered\u201d\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n   - **Emergency notification**: For emergencies, the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately; failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency \u201crelieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages\u201d\u301010\u2020L6-L6\u3011.\n\n   These requirements are explicitly tied to the same 1\u2011year/60\u2011day periods that run from the coverage start (\u201ccommencement\u201d)\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011\u301019\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **coverage start** is clearly defined as the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n- All **time\u2011based end points** (1\u2011year and 60\u2011day limits) are measured from that same commencement date\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011.\n- The warranty is **non\u2011transferable**, so sale of the home or the first purchaser moving out terminates coverage even if the 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day period has not yet elapsed\u301010\u2020L8-L8\u3011.\n- The requirement that claims be made in writing within the applicable period ties the **procedural condition** (written notice) directly to the coverage start and its time limits\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011\u301010\u2020L6-L6\u3011.\n\nTogether, these provisions create a unified framework: coverage begins at a specific, defined event; it continues only for the first purchaser; and it ends at the earlier of (a) the applicable time limit from commencement, or (b) sale/move\u2011out, with written notice required before those time limits for any claim to be honored.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this warranty, coverage starts automatically on the **earlier of the date of final settlement or the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011. From that commencement date, different components are covered either for **one year** or for **60 days**, and coverage for each category ends when its respective period (1 year or 60 days) expires, measured from that start date\u301010\u2020L1-L2\u3011. Coverage also ends earlier if the **first purchaser sells the home or moves out**, because the warranty is non\u2011transferable and automatically terminates in those events\u301010\u2020L8-L8\u3011. In addition, any claim must be made **in writing within the applicable 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day period**, or it is not covered\u301010\u2020L2-L2\u3011\u301010\u2020L6-L6\u3011.",

The applicable time period (one year or sixty days) after the coverage start elapses, and/or  \n2. The first purchaser sells the home or moves out (automatic termination), and  \n3. In practical terms, any claim not submitted in writing before those deadlines is treated as outside coverage.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Single start point, multiple durations:** All coverages begin at the same defined \u201ccommencement\u201d (final settlement or first occupancy, whichever is earlier) [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [46], [55], [56], [57], [63], [64], [68], [69], [71], [74], but different components of the home have different lengths of coverage (one year vs. sixty days) [10], [22], [32], [37], [56], [57], [63], [68], [71].\n\n- **Time limits plus procedural requirement:** The end of coverage is not only a matter of time passing; the owner must also submit any claims in writing before the applicable period expires, or those claims are excluded [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [46], [55], [56], [57], [63], [64], [68], [69], [71], [74].\n\n- **Ownership status as an additional termination trigger:** Even within the time window, if the first purchaser sells or moves out, the warranty terminates automatically [10], [22], [32], [37], [56], [57], [63], [68], [71], [74]. This connects the temporal limits with an ownership/occupancy condition.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this Builders Limited Warranty, coverage starts on the earlier of the date of final settlement or the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [46], [55], [56], [57], [63], [64], [68], [69], [71], [74]. From that start date, different parts of the home are covered for either one year or sixty days, and the warranty terminates for each item when its applicable period (one year or sixty days) has elapsed [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [46], [55], [56], [57], [63], [64], [68], [69], [71], [74].

How \u201ccoverage start\u201d is defined\n\nIn the Builders Limited Warranty, the start of coverage is defined in the \u201cTerm\u201d section:\n\n- Coverage begins on **\u201cthe date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first.\u201d** [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [42], [44], [54], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n\nThis means the triggering event for warranty commencement is the earlier of:\n1. The date of final settlement (closing), or  \n2. The date the buyer/owner first moves in and occupies the home.  \n\nNo additional actions (like registration) are required in the text; the warranty automatically starts on that earlier date. [10], [22], [32], [42], [52], [58], [60], [63], [72], [79]\n\n### Q2. What must happen before coverage ends (end-of-coverage triggers)\n\nThe warranty describes several ways coverage can end, all tied to time limits or ownership status:\n\n1. **Expiration of the stated warranty periods (time limits)**  \n   - The warranty has two main durations:\n     - One (1) year coverage for structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical, and roof. [10], [22], [32], [60], [63], [79]\n     - Sixty (60) days coverage for specified items such as doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, etc. [10], [22], [32], [60], [63], [79]\n   - The Term clause states:  \n     - \u201cExcept as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [42], [44], [54], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n\n   Thus, once the applicable period (1 year or 60 days from the coverage start) elapses, coverage for that category of items ends.\n\n2. **Failure to submit claims in writing within the warranty period**  \n   - The warranty explicitly requires written claims within the applicable period:  \n     - \u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [54], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n   - The Notification of Defects section reinforces this:  \n     - The Buyer/Owner must, **\u201cprior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable, write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested\u201d** to the builder\u2019s address. [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [54], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n   - Any claim not made in writing within those time limits is excluded:  \n     - \u201cAny and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable\u201d are excluded from coverage. [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [54], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n\n   Practically, this means that even if a defect appears within the warranty period, coverage ends for that defect if the owner does not send the required written notice before the period expires.\n\n3. **Transfer of the home (change of first purchaser / occupancy)**  \n   - The warranty is expressly non\u2011transferable:  \n     - \u201cThis limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [54], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n   - It terminates automatically if the first purchaser sells or moves out:  \n     - \u201cIn the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [54], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n\n   So, another end-of-coverage trigger is the first purchaser either selling the home or moving out, even if the 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day period has not yet fully run.\n\n4. **Emergency notification requirement (affecting liability, not the basic term)**  \n   - For emergencies, the owner must telephone the builder immediately; failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency \u201crelieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [54], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n   - This does not change the formal end date of the warranty term, but it effectively ends coverage for that emergency-related damage if prompt notice is not given.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **start of coverage** is tied to a specific, objective event: the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n- The **end of coverage** is governed by:\n  - Fixed time periods (1 year or 60 days) counted from that start date. [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n  - Procedural requirements (written claim by certified mail before the period ends). [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n  - Ownership/occupancy status (automatic termination if the first purchaser sells or moves out). [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [61], [68], [70], [80]\n\nThese elements work together: coverage begins automatically at a defined event, runs for a defined period, and can be cut off earlier by transfer of the home or by failure to comply with the written-claim and emergency-notice requirements.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn the Builders Limited Warranty, coverage starts on the **earlier of the date of final settlement or the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**. [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [61], [68], [70], [80] Coverage then continues only for the specified durations\u2014**one year** for major systems and structure, and **sixty days** for listed finish items\u2014measured from that start date, and only if the Buyer/Owner submits any claims **in writing by certified mail before those periods expire**. [10], [19], [22], [34], [38], [40], [61], [68], [70], [80] The warranty also **automatically ends** if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, because the warranty is non\u2011transferable.

ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011\u301031\u2020L19-L24\u3011\n\nFrom this:\n\n1. **Duration tied to coverage start**  \n   - For the structural and major systems items (floors, ceilings, walls, plumbing, heating, electrical, roof), the warranty period is **one (1) year** from the commencement date\u301010\u2020L13-L21\u3011.  \n   - For specified items like doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, plumbing fixtures, and cabinet work, the warranty period is **sixty (60) days** from the same commencement date\u301010\u2020L21-L27\u3011.  \n   - Both the 1\u2011year and 60\u2011day periods are explicitly measured **\u201cafter commencement\u201d**, i.e., after the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy\u301010\u2020L19-L27\u3011.\n\n2. **Events/conditions that must occur before coverage ends**\n   - **Passage of time from commencement**:  \n     - Coverage for one\u2011year items ends automatically **one year after the coverage start**\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011.  \n     - Coverage for sixty\u2011day items ends automatically **60 days after the coverage start**\u301010\u2020L21-L27\u3011.\n   - **Written claim requirement before the end of the period**:  \n     - The warranty states that **any claims not made in writing within the applicable 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day period are not covered**, \u201cregardless of discoverability\u201d\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011.  \n     - Section 6 further requires that, before the end of the applicable period, the Buyer/Owner must **write a letter describing the defect and send it by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Builder**\u301010\u2020L63-L71\u3011. If this is not done before the period expires, the claim is excluded\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011\u301019\u2020L22-L27\u3011.\n\n3. **Additional termination trigger: transfer of the home**\n   - The warranty is **not transferable** and terminates if the original Buyer/Owner sells or moves out:\n\n     > \u201cThis limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. **In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.**\u201d\u301010\u2020L79-L83\u3011\u301030\u2020L79-L83\u3011\n\n   - Thus, even if the 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day period has not fully elapsed, coverage ends immediately upon sale or move\u2011out by the first purchaser\u301010\u2020L79-L83\u3011.\n\n4. **Relationship between start and end-of-coverage triggers**\n   - **Start**: earlier of final settlement or first occupancy\u301010\u2020L19-L22\u3011.  \n   - **End**:\n     - Automatically at **1 year** (for major items) or **60 days** (for listed minor items) **after that start date**\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011, unless otherwise provided.  \n     - Sooner if the **first purchaser sells or moves out**, because the warranty is non\u2011transferable and terminates at that event\u301010\u2020L79-L83\u3011.  \n     - Practically, for any defect to be covered, the Buyer/Owner must **submit a written claim by certified mail before the applicable period expires**\u301010\u2020L63-L71\u3011; otherwise, even if the defect arose during the period, it is excluded\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The warranty\u2019s \u201ccoverage start\u201d is a single, clearly defined **commencement date**: the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy\u301010\u2020L19-L22\u3011.\n- All coverage durations (1\u2011year and 60\u2011day) are measured **from that same commencement date**, so the end of coverage is directly tied to when coverage starts\u301010\u2020L19-L27\u3011.\n- Coverage can end in three ways, all defined relative to that start:\n  1. **Time-based expiration**: 1 year or 60 days after commencement\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011.\n  2. **Failure to act**: no written claim submitted by certified mail before the applicable period ends\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011\u301010\u2020L63-L71\u3011.\n  3. **Transfer event**: sale of the home or move\u2011out by the first purchaser, which automatically terminates the warranty regardless of remaining time\u301010\u2020L79-L83\u3011.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty, \u201ccoverage start\u201d is defined as the **earlier of the date of final settlement or the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**\u301010\u2020L19-L22\u3011. From that commencement date, coverage runs for **one year** for major structural and system components and **sixty days** for specified minor items\u301010\u2020L13-L21\u3011. Coverage ends when the applicable 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day period measured from that start date expires, unless it ends sooner because the original Buyer/Owner sells or moves out of the home (automatic termination)\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011\u301010\u2020L79-L83\u3011. For any defect to be covered, the Buyer/Owner must also **submit a written claim by certified mail before the applicable period expires**; claims made after that time are not covered, even if the defect existed earlier\u301010\u2020L22-L27\u3011\u301010\u2020L63-L71\u3011.",
