  "response": "## Answer\n\nAcross these documents, the \u201cwho pays what\u201d can be summarized as follows:\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract:**  \n  - The **Owner (Contoso Ltd.)** must pay the **Pumper (Fabrikam Inc.)** all charges incurred for servicing the holding tank(s), on terms mutually agreed between them. [1], [13]  \n  - The Owner must also maintain the access road/drive at their own expense so the Pumper can service the tanks. [13]  \n  - No taxes or government fees are explicitly allocated to either party in this contract. [1], [13]\n\n- **Purchase Contract for Vertical Platform Lift (Contoso Lifts LLC \u2013 Fabrikam Inc.):**  \n  - The **Customer (Fabrikam Inc.)** must pay the **Contractor (Contoso Lifts LLC.)** a total contract price of **$29,900.00**, in three installments: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, and $2,900 upon completion. [2], [12]  \n  - If the Customer defaults on payment, the Contractor may take legal action and recover legal fees from the Customer. [2], [12]  \n  - For permitting, the Contractor only assists; the **Customer bears any additional compliance costs** (e.g., extra costs to meet code or permit requirements). [2], [11]  \n  - The contract does not separately list sales tax; the total price is stated as $29,900.00 without a tax breakdown. [2], [12]\n\n- **Contoso Lifts Invoice (to Fabrikam Construction / John Doe):**  \n  - The **Customer (Fabrikam Construction / John Doe)** is billed a **subtotal of $29,900.00**, with **TAX listed as \u201cN/A\u201d**, so the **total and amount due are $29,900.00**. [4], [5], [18]  \n  - Payment is due \u201con contract signing,\u201d aligning with the initial payment requirement in the contract. [4], [5]  \n  - The invoice instructs that all checks be made payable to **Contoso Lifts LLC**, so the Customer pays Contoso Lifts LLC directly. [4], [5]\n\n- **Property Management Agreement (Hawaii rental property):**  \n  - The **Owner** must pay the **Agent** a **non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee of $250.00 upon execution** of the agreement. [8], [9], [19]  \n  - The Owner must pay a **management fee/commission** to the Agent:  \n    - **25% of gross revenues** for short\u2011term/vacation rentals (reservations < 180 days). [15], [16], [17]  \n    - **10% of gross revenues** for long\u2011term leases (leases > 180 days). [15], [16], [21]  \n  - The Owner must pay a **pro\u2011ration charge for advertising** for short\u2011term/vacation rentals at **$75.00 per month**. [14], [15], [21]  \n  - The Owner must pay a **minimum administration and accounting charge of $50.00 per month** (excluding tax preparation/returns/forms). [14], [20], [21]  \n  - For repairs, upgrades, and renovations:  \n    - The Owner pays a **fee of 10% of the total charge** for such work to the Agent. [14], [20]  \n    - The Owner pays a **$35/hour charge** for the Agent\u2019s time to schedule or escort contractors, repair persons, technicians, and handymen. [8], [20]  \n  - The Agent is allowed to **accept credit cards and deduct credit card/bankcard fees from the Owner\u2019s proceeds**, meaning the Owner effectively bears those transaction costs. [16], [17]  \n  - The **Owner must also pay Hawaii Gross Excise Tax (currently 4.712%)** on **all the Agent\u2019s fees, commissions, and charges** listed above. [8], [9]  \n  - For advertising, the Agent pays the media invoices and then **passes the advertising cost on to the Owner** via the monthly proceeds statements. [10]\n\n## Details\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract \u2013 Cost Allocation**  \n  - The Owner agrees \u201cto have the holding tank(s) serviced by the pumper\u201d and \u201cfurther agrees to pay the pumper for all charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.\u201d [1], [13]  \n  - The Owner must \u201cmaintain the all\u2011weather access road or drive so that the pumper can service the holding tank(s) with the pumping equipment,\u201d implying the Owner bears those maintenance costs. [13]  \n  - The Pumper\u2019s obligations are reporting and compliance (submitting service reports to the County), not payment of service fees; the contract does not state that the Pumper pays any fees to the Owner. [1], [3], [13]\n\n- **Lift Purchase Contract \u2013 Fees, Charges, and Risk**  \n  - The total contract price is explicitly stated as \u201c$29,900.00, payable in 3 installments: $20,000.00 upon signing; $7,000.00 upon delivery; $2,900.00 upon completion,\u201d which the Customer must pay to the Contractor. [2], [12]  \n  - \u201cFailure to pay may result in legal action. Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor,\u201d so if the Customer defaults, the Customer ultimately pays the Contractor\u2019s legal fees. [2], [12]  \n  - Under \u201cPermitting,\u201d \u201cContractor assists with permitting. Customer bears any additional compliance costs,\u201d so any extra costs to meet code or permit requirements are paid by the Customer, not the Contractor. [2], [11]  \n  - The contract is governed by Florida law, but no specific tax obligations are itemized; the price is a lump sum. [2]\n\n- **Contoso Lifts Invoice \u2013 Amounts and Tax Treatment**  \n  - The invoice lists line items totaling a **SUBTOTAL of 29,900.00** for the lift, power system, cab, outdoor fitting, door, and hall call stations. [4], [5], [18]  \n  - The **TAX line is \u201cN/A\u201d**, and both **TOTAL** and **AMOUNT DUE** are **29,900.00**, indicating no separate tax is charged on this invoice. [4], [5], [18]  \n  - Terms state \u201cDue on contract signing,\u201d so the Customer must pay this amount at signing. [4], [5]  \n  - The invoice directs: \u201cMake all checks payable to Contoso Lifts LLC,\u201d so the Customer pays Contoso Lifts LLC. [4], [5]\n\n- **Property Management Agreement \u2013 Owner\u2011Paid Fees and Taxes**  \n  - Start\u2011up: \u201cUpon the execution of this Agreement, the Owner shall pay two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the Agent as a non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee,\u201d used for initial administrative expenses, inventory, and inspection. [8], [9], [19]  \n  - Management commissions:  \n    - \u201cA fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).\u201d [15], [16], [17]  \n    - \u201cA fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).\u201d [15], [16], [21]  \n  - Advertising: \u201cA pro\u2011ration charge for advertising for short\u2011term (vacation rentals), at $75.00/month.\u201d [14], [15], [21]  \n  - Administration/accounting: \u201cA minimum charge for administration and accounting, at $50.00/month (not to include tax preparation/returns/forms).\u201d [14], [20], [21]  \n  - Repairs/renovations:  \n    - \u201cA fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.\u201d [14], [20]  \n    - \u201cA charge of $35/hour to schedule repairs, upgrades, renovations, replacement of appliances, carpets, curtains, drapes, and/or to escort the contractors, repair persons, technicians and handymen.\u201d [8], [20]  \n  - Credit card/bankcard fees: \u201cAgent is allowed by Owner to accept credit cards and to deduct for credit card and/or bankcard fees from the Owner\u2019s proceeds,\u201d so these fees are effectively paid by the Owner. [16], [17]  \n  - Hawaii Gross Excise Tax: \u201cPlus, the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges,\u201d so the Owner pays this tax on every fee/commission/charge the Agent imposes. [8], [9]  \n  - Advertising pass\u2011through: The Agent will \u201cProvide the invoice(s) from the media, and pay the charges and pass on the cost to the Owner, on the monthly proceeds statements,\u201d so the Owner ultimately pays the advertising costs.
