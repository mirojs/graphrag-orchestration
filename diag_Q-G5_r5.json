{"response":"## Answer\n\nThe documents describe a binding arbitration program (with limited court exceptions), small-claims court as an alternative forum for low-value money claims, preservation of certain self-help and lien-related remedies, and the ability to seek provisional/ancillary relief (e.g., injunctions, attachment) in court. All other disputes must be resolved by binding arbitration administered under AAA (or similar) rules, with Idaho substantive law applying and arbitral awards enforceable in court. [1][2][3][6][7][9][10][11][12][13][14]\n\n## Details\n\n- **Mandatory binding arbitration for most disputes**:  \n  - All disputes (as defined) that cannot be litigated in the Idaho small claims court are subject to binding arbitration under the Arbitration Program. [2][3][7]  \n  - The parties expressly agree that disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration rather than in court, and once decided by arbitration, no dispute can later be brought, filed, or pursued in court except to enforce the arbitrator’s decision. [6][10][13][14]\n\n- **Scope of “Dispute”**:  \n  - A “Dispute” includes any action, dispute, claim, or controversy of any kind, whether based in contract, tort, statutory or common law, equity, or otherwise, that cannot be litigated in the Idaho Small Claims Court, arising out of or connected with the construction or purchase of the home, the warranty, or related agreements/documents. [3][7]\n\n- **Small-claims court exception**:  \n  - Claims for money that do not exceed $3,000 and fall within the venue and jurisdiction of the Small Claims Department of the Magistrate Division of the District Courts of the State of Idaho (as defined at Idaho Code § 1‑2301) may be pursued in that small-claims forum instead of arbitration. [1]  \n  - The warranty text reiterates that, with the exception of the remedies preserved (including money claims within Idaho small-claims jurisdiction limits), all disputes are subject to binding arbitration. [2][3]\n\n- **Preserved non-arbitration remedies**:  \n  - The arbitration clause does not limit the right of any party to:  \n    1. Pursue qualifying small-claims actions in Idaho small-claims court. [1]  \n    2. Pursue claims of lien or foreclose a lien or mortgage against real or personal property collateral or security, as necessary to preserve such remedy or to enforce any arbitration award or obtain a personal or deficiency award. [1]  \n    3. Exercise self-help remedies, including repossession and set-off rights. [1]  \n    4. Obtain provisional or ancillary remedies such as injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim and delivery, replevin, garnishment, or appointment of a receiver from a court having jurisdiction. [1]\n\n- **Arbitration administration and rules**:  \n  - Arbitration is to be administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or another mutually agreeable administrator, in accordance with the Arbitration Program and the AAA’s Building Arbitration Rules or other mutually agreed rules. [4][5][6][9][12][13]  \n  - Proceedings are governed by the provisions of the AAA (or other agreed rules). [6][9][10][12]\n\n- **Selection and powers of arbitrator(s)**:  \n  - The parties agree to select a neutral “qualified” arbitrator; if they cannot agree, they proceed as provided by AAA provisions (subject to the contract’s specific terms). [4][5]  \n  - The arbitrator(s) may, upon written request of any party, consolidate multiple-party claims that are substantially identical or based on the same underlying transaction, and consolidate related claims/disputes involving other parties (including subcontractors or suppliers). [5]  \n  - In any consolidated proceeding, the first arbitrator(s) selected will conduct the consolidated proceeding unless disqualified due to conflict of interest. [5][8]  \n  - The arbitrator(s) are empowered to resolve disputes regarding the terms of the arbitration clause, including questions about arbitrability, but have no power to change or alter the terms of the Arbitration Program. [8]\n\n- **Costs, fees, and sanctions**:  \n  - Each party must pay one-half of the arbitration costs and fees and bear its own respective costs, including attorneys’ fees, in any arbitration. [8]  \n  - Any party that fails to submit to binding arbitration after a lawful demand must bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees (including those incurred in any trial, bankruptcy proceeding, or on appeal), incurred by the other party in obtaining a stay of judicial proceedings and compelling arbitration. [7]  \n  - The arbitrator(s) are empowered to impose sanctions for any party’s failure to proceed within the time limits established (e.g., the 180‑day target to conclude arbitration). [11]\n\n- **Governing law and limitations**:  \n  - The arbitrator(s) must resolve all disputes in accordance with the applicable substantive law of the State of Idaho. [9][10][12]  \n  - All statutes of limitation applicable to any dispute apply to arbitration proceedings under this clause. [11]\n\n- **Timeframe for arbitration**:  \n  - The parties agree, to the maximum extent practicable, to take any action necessary to conclude an arbitration within 180 days of filing a dispute with the administrator, and the arbitrator(s) may sanction parties for failure to proceed within these timeframes. [11]\n\n- **Enforcement of awards in court**:  \n  - Judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. [1][10]  \n  - Court involvement is thus limited to enforcing the arbitrator’s decision and to the preserved remedies (small claims, liens, self-help, and provisional/ancillary relief). [1][6][10][13][14]\n\n- **Effect of sale or move-out on warranty vs. remedies**:  \n  - If the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, the limited warranty automatically terminates; however, the text notes that the remedies preserved (including small-claims money claims within Idaho jurisdiction limits) remain, and all disputes are still subject to binding arbitration under the Arbitration Program.
