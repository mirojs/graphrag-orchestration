  "response": "## Summary\n\nThe agreement provides that most disputes must be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or another mutually agreed administrator, under AAA Building Arbitration Rules or other mutually agreed rules, applying Idaho substantive law, with any arbitration award enforceable in court. [1][2][9][12][13][15][16] Certain remedies are expressly preserved outside arbitration: (1) small-claims court actions in Idaho for money claims not exceeding \u201c$3,000\u201d; (2) lien and mortgage foreclosure actions to preserve or enforce security interests or arbitration awards; (3) self-help remedies (including repossession and set-off); and (4) provisional or ancillary judicial remedies such as injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim and delivery, replevin, garnishment, or appointment of a receiver. [4] The arbitrator may consolidate related claims, decide questions about arbitrability, impose sanctions for delay, and must issue a written award stating the factual and legal basis; each party pays half of the arbitration costs and its own attorneys\u2019 fees. [7][8][11][14] A party that refuses to submit to arbitration after a lawful demand must pay the other party\u2019s costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees incurred to stay court proceedings and compel arbitration. [10] All statutes of limitation apply to arbitration, the parties aim to conclude arbitration within \u201c180 days\u201d of filing, arbitrations occur in Pocatello, Idaho, and proceedings are to be kept confidential subject to legal or ordinary-course-of-business disclosures. [14][15]\n\n## Key Points\n\n- All disputes that cannot be brought in Idaho small-claims court and that arise out of the construction or purchase of the home, the warranty, or related documents must be resolved by binding arbitration if demanded within the specified time window. [1][6][10][16]  \n- Arbitration is administered by the AAA or another mutually agreed administrator, under AAA Building Arbitration Rules or other mutually agreed rules, applying the substantive law of the State of Idaho. [2][9][12][13][15]  \n- Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. [2][4][13]  \n- Preserved non-arbitration remedies:  \n  - Small-claims actions in the Small Claims Department of the Magistrate Division of the Idaho District Courts for money claims not exceeding \u201c$3,000.\u201d [4]  \n  - Actions to pursue or foreclose liens or mortgages on real or personal property collateral, including to enforce an arbitration award or obtain a personal or deficiency award. [4]  \n  - Self-help remedies, including repossession and set-off rights. [4]  \n  - Provisional or ancillary judicial remedies: injunctive relief, sequestration, attachment, claim and delivery, replevin, garnishment, or appointment of a receiver. [4]  \n- A party that fails to submit to arbitration after a lawful demand must bear all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees (including those incurred at trial, in bankruptcy, or on appeal), that the other party incurs to stay judicial proceedings and compel arbitration. [10]  \n- Arbitrator powers and procedures:  \n  - Neutral \u201cqualified\u201d arbitrator to be selected; if parties cannot agree, selection follows AAA provisions. [7][8]  \n  - Power to consolidate substantially identical or transaction-related multiple-party claims, including claims involving subcontractors or suppliers; the first selected arbitrator conducts any consolidated proceeding unless disqualified. [8][11]  \n  - Power to resolve disputes about the arbitration clause itself, including arbitrability, but not to change the arbitration program\u2019s terms. [11]  \n  - Must issue a written award stating the factual and legal basis. [11]  \n  - May impose sanctions for failure to proceed within established time limits. [14]  \n- Cost allocation: each party pays one-half of the arbitration costs and fees and its own costs, including attorneys\u2019 fees, in the arbitration. [11]  \n- Timing and limitations: applicable statutes of limitation apply; parties agree to take necessary action to conclude arbitration within \u201c180 days\u201d of filing with the administrator. [14]  \n- Location and confidentiality: arbitrations are conducted in Pocatello, Idaho; parties agree to keep disputes and arbitration proceedings strictly confidential, subject to disclosures required by law or in the ordinary course of business.
