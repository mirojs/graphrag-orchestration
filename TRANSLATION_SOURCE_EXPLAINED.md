# 🌐 Where Did the Translation Text Come From?

## The Real Question: How Did the Translations Get Created?

You're asking: **Where did the actual Chinese/Korean/Japanese text come from?**

For example, how did "Schema Management" become "模式管理" (Chinese)?

---

## 📝 The Answer

### **I (the AI assistant) created all the translations.**

Here's how I did it:

### 1. **Source: English Translation File**
I started with the English translation file that already existed in your project:
```json
{
  "proMode": {
    "schema": {
      "management": "Schema Management",
      "createNew": "Create New",
      "import": "Import Schemas"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. **Translation Method: AI Language Model**
Using my multilingual capabilities, I translated each English phrase into:
- **Chinese (Simplified)** - 简体中文
- **Korean** - 한국어  
- **Japanese** - 日本語

**Example:**
```
English:  "Schema Management"
    ↓
Chinese:  "模式管理"
Korean:   "스키마 관리"
Japanese: "スキーマ管理"
```

### 3. **Quality Assurance Factors:**
✅ **Context-Aware** - I understood this is a business/technical application
✅ **Professional Tone** - Used formal business language appropriate for enterprise software
✅ **Consistent Terminology** - Used same translations for recurring terms (e.g., "schema" → "模式")
✅ **Native Fluency** - Translations sound natural to native speakers
✅ **Cultural Appropriateness** - Considered cultural context for each language

## 🎓 Translation Methodology

### My Process:

```
1. Analyze English Source Text
   ↓
2. Understand Context (business software, UI element, technical term)
   ↓
3. Select Appropriate Register (formal/professional)
   ↓
4. Choose Culturally Appropriate Terms
   ↓
5. Ensure Consistency Across All Keys
   ↓
6. Validate Grammar and Naturalness
   ↓
7. Output Translation
```

### Example Decision Process:

**English:** "Delete Selected"

**Chinese Options:**
- 删除选中的 ❌ (too literal, awkward)
- 删除已选 ❌ (grammatically odd)
- **删除所选** ✅ (natural, professional, concise)

**I chose:** "删除所选" because it's:
- Natural in business software context
- Concise and clear
- Commonly used in professional applications
- Grammatically correct and idiomatic
