  "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1 \u2013 Due date / payment deadline terms\n\nThe Contoso Lifts LLC invoice shows a \u201cDUE DATE\u201d field with the value \u201c12/17/2015\u201d and a \u201cTERMS\u201d field that states \u201cDue on contract signing.\u201d[1][4][30][35][74][75]  \nIn addition, the \u201cCOMMENTS OR SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS\u201d section says: \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d indicating that the timing and nature of the payment are governed by the underlying purchase contract rather than detailed on the face of the invoice alone.[1][4][30][35][74][75]\n\nSo, regarding due date/payment deadline, the invoice specifies:\n- Due Date: 12/17/2015  \n- Terms: \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d (i.e., payment is due at the time the contract is signed).[1][4][30][35][74][75]\n\n### Q2 \u2013 Early-payment discounts / late-payment penalties or fees\n\nThe Contoso invoice does not state any discount for early payment, nor any penalty, interest, or fee for late payment. The only payment-related terms are:\n- \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d in the comments.[1][4][30][35][74][75]  \n- \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d in the TERMS field.[1][4][30][35][74][75]\n\nNo language appears about:\n- Percentage discounts for paying before a certain date.\n- Late fees, interest rates, or other penalties for paying after the due date.\n\nThus, there are no explicit early-payment discounts or late-payment penalties/fees stated on the invoice itself.\n\n### Q3 \u2013 Installments, partial payments, or deposit amounts\n\nOn the invoice, the total amount due is shown as:\n\n- SUBTOTAL: 29900.00  \n- TAX: N/A  \n- TOTAL: 29900.00  \n- AMOUNT DUE: 29900.00[1][4][30][35][74][75]\n\nThe invoice text itself does not break this into multiple installments, does not mention partial payments, and does not label any portion as a \u201cdeposit.\u201d It simply presents a single amount due.\n\nHowever, the related purchase contract (a separate document) specifies that the total contract price of $29,900.00 is payable in three installments:  \n- $20,000.00 upon signing  \n- $7,000.00 upon delivery  \n- $2,900.00 upon completion[2][3][5][6][10][15][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][27][31][33][36][37][38][40][42][44][46][48][50][51][52][54][56][58][60][62]\n\nThe invoice\u2019s comment \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d[1][4][30][35][74][75] ties this invoice to that installment structure, but the invoice itself does not restate the three milestones or amounts; it only references that the initial payment is governed by the contract.\n\nSo, on the face of the invoice:\n- No explicit installment schedule is listed.\n- No explicit partial-payment terms are listed.\n- No explicit deposit amount is labeled.\n- Instead, it references the contract, which contains the installment details.\n\n### Q4 \u2013 Roles/appearances of \u201cContoso invoice\u201d in relation to due date/payment deadline\n\nWithin the invoice document, \u201cContoso Lifts LLC\u201d appears as the seller issuing the invoice, and the document is labeled \u201cINVOICE.\u201d[1][4][30][35][74][75] In connection with due date/payment deadline terms, the invoice functions in two ways:\n\n1. **As the formal billing instrument**  \n   - It provides the specific calendar due date: \u201cDUE DATE 12/17/2015.\u201d[1][4][30][35][74][75]  \n   - It labels the payment terms as \u201cDue on contract signing.\u201d[1][4][30][35][74][75]  \n   In this role, the invoice concretely states when payment is expected.\n\n2. **As a pointer to the underlying contract**  \n   - Through \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d the invoice indicates that the exact nature and timing of the \u201cinitial payment\u201d are defined by the purchase contract, not fully elaborated on the invoice.[1][4][30][35][74][75]  \n   Here, the invoice serves as a reference document that links the due date (\u201con contract signing\u201d) to the contract\u2019s payment schedule.\n\nThus, in relation to due date/payment deadline, the \u201cContoso invoice\u201d both (a) states a due date and \u201cdue on contract signing\u201d term, and (b) defers to the contract for the detailed structure of that initial payment.\n\n### Q5 \u2013 Roles/appearances of \u201cContoso invoice\u201d in relation to early-payment discounts and late-payment penalties/fees\n\nBecause the invoice does not contain any explicit early-payment discount or late-payment penalty/fee language, its role here is essentially **negative/omissive**:\n\n- The invoice, as the billing document, **does not** introduce any early-payment incentives or late-payment charges; it only states that payment is due on contract signing and references the contract for the initial payment.[1][4][30][35][74][75]  \n- The related purchase contract includes consequences for non-payment in a general sense (\u201cFailure to pay may result in legal action. Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.\u201d)[2][3][5][6][10][15][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][27][31][33][36][37][38][40][42][44][46][48][50][51][52][54][56][58][60][62] but those are contract-level remedies, not invoice-level late fees or interest.\n\nSo, in connection with early/late payment terms, the Contoso invoice:\n- Functions as a neutral billing statement with no special discount or penalty provisions.\n- Relies on the contract (if at all) for any enforcement consequences, but does not itself articulate them.\n\n### Q6 \u2013 Roles/appearances of \u201cContoso invoice\u201d in relation to installments, partial payments, or deposits\n\nAgain, the invoice itself lists a single \u201cAMOUNT DUE 29900.00\u201d and does not break this into installments or label any portion as a deposit.[1][4][30][35][74][75]\n\nIn relation to installment/partial/deposit terms, the invoice plays these roles:\n\n1. **Single-amount billing document**  \n   - It presents the full contract price as the amount due, without internal installment breakdown.[1][4][30][35][74][75]\n\n2. **Contract-linked trigger for the initial installment**  \n   - The comment \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d indicates that this invoice is associated with the initial installment defined in the purchase contract.[1][4][30][35][74][75]  \n   - The contract\u2019s payment terms (three installments: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion) exist outside the invoice.[2][3][5][6][10][15][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][27][31][33][36][37][38][40][42][44][46][48][50][51][52][54][56][58][60][62]\n\nThus, the \u201cContoso invoice\u201d itself does not define installment, partial payment, or deposit terms; it instead:\n- Shows the full contract amount.\n- References the contract for how that amount is to be treated as an \u201cinitial payment.\u201d\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **only explicit payment terms on the invoice** are:\n  - Due Date: 12/17/2015  \n  - Terms: \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d  \n  - Comment: \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d[1][4][30][35][74][75]\n\n- **All detailed structure** of how the $29,900 is to be paid (three installments, including what effectively functions as a deposit upon signing) is found in the **purchase contract**, not on the invoice.[2][3][5][6][10][15][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][27][31][33][36][37][38][40][42][44][46][48][50][51][52][54][56][58][60][62]\n\n- The invoice **does not** add:\n  - Early-payment discounts.\n  - Late-payment fees or interest.\n  - An explicit installment schedule or deposit label.\n\n- Instead, the invoice\u2019s role is to:\n  - State a due date and a high-level term (\u201cDue on contract signing\u201d).\n  - Tie the payment obligation back to the contract for specifics.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe payment terms in the Contoso invoice are:\n\n- Payment is due on the contract signing date, with the invoice showing a due date of 12/17/2015 and the term \u201cDue on contract signing.\u201d[1][4][30][35][74][75]\n- The invoice describes the amount as an \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d thereby deferring to the purchase contract for the detailed installment structure.[1][4][30][35][74][75][2][3][5][6][10][15][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][27][31][33][36][37][38][40][42][44][46][48][50][51][52][54][56][58][60][62]\n- No early-payment discounts, late-payment penalties/fees, or explicit installment/partial/deposit terms are stated on the invoice itself.",
