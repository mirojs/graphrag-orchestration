Required notification channel(s) and timing for an emergency defect (e.g., burst pipe)\n\nUnder the Builder’s Limited Warranty, the general rule for reporting defects is written notice by certified mail:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner “must…write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder's office address” before the end of the applicable warranty period (one year or sixty days, depending on the item).[4][8]  \n\nHowever, the agreement creates a special rule for emergencies, explicitly using the example of a burst pipe:\n\n- “If an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[7]  \n\nFrom this:\n\n- **Required channel for an emergency (e.g., burst pipe):**  \n  - Immediate **telephone call** to the Builder’s emergency number.[7]  \n- **Other channels (for non‑emergency or follow‑up):**  \n  - Written letter sent by **certified mail, return receipt requested** to the Builder’s office address, within the applicable warranty period.[4][8]  \n- **Time limits:**  \n  - For emergencies, notification must be **“immediately”** by phone.[7]  \n  - For warranty coverage generally, any claim must be made **in writing within the one‑year or sixty‑day warranty period**, as applicable; otherwise it is not covered.[2][8][9]  \n\nThe Property Management Agreement and the Holding Tank Servicing Contract do not address emergency defect notification or warranty procedures; they concern property management and tank servicing obligations, not builder warranty claims.[1][3] The emergency notification rules therefore come from the Builder’s Limited Warranty.\n\n### 2. Consequences of delayed or missing emergency notification\n\nThe warranty states a specific consequence for failing to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency:\n\n- “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty **relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages**.”[5][7][10]  \n\nIn addition, the exclusions section separately addresses damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice:\n\n- The warranty excludes “**Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder**.”[9][12]  \n\nCombined, the consequences are:\n\n- If the Buyer/Owner does not promptly notify the Builder of an emergency:\n  - The Builder is **relieved of all liability** for:\n    - Replacement of the defective item;  \n    - Repair of the defect;  \n    - “All other damages” related to that emergency.[5][7][10]  \n- Even where a defect might otherwise be covered, any **additional damages** that “could have been avoided by prompt notification” are excluded from coverage.[9][12]  \n\nSeparately, if the Buyer/Owner fails to make a written claim within the warranty period, the claim is not covered at all:\n\n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.”[8]  \n- The exclusions reiterate: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable” are excluded.[9][12]  \n\nSo there are two layers of consequence:\n\n1. **Emergency-specific:** No prompt emergency notice → Builder has no liability for replacement, repair, or any damages for that emergency.[5][7][10]  \n2. **General timing:** No written claim within the warranty period → the claim is not covered at all.[8][9]  \n\n### 3. Relationship between correct notification channel and consequences of delay\n\nThe warranty text links both the **channel** and the **timing** to the consequences:\n\n1. **Channel for emergencies: phone only**\n\n   - “If an emergency exists… the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately. **Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.**”[7]  \n\n   This means:\n   - For an emergency like a burst pipe, the contract requires **telephone** notification, not email or other channels.[7]  \n   - The phrase “only emergency reports will be taken by phone” indicates that phone is the designated and exclusive channel for emergency reporting; other channels are not treated as proper emergency notice.[7]  \n\n2. **Consequence tied to prompt emergency notification**\n\n   - “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[5][7][10]  \n\n   The obligation is to **promptly notify** the Builder of an emergency, and the specified method for that notification is by **telephone**.[7] Thus:\n\n   - If the Buyer/Owner delays the phone call, the Builder is relieved of all liability for that emergency.[5][7][10]  \n   - If the Buyer/Owner uses an **incorrect channel** (e.g., only sends a letter or email and does not call), that likely fails the requirement to “telephone the Builder immediately,” so the Builder can argue that the Buyer/Owner did not “promptly notify” as required, triggering the same consequence (no liability).[7][10]  \n\n3. **Interaction with written notice requirement**\n\n   - For any warranty claim (emergency or not), the Buyer/Owner must also submit a **written letter by certified mail** within the applicable warranty period.[4][8][9]  \n\n   Therefore, for an emergency defect like a burst pipe, the full compliance path is:\n\n   - **Step 1 (emergency):** Immediate **telephone** notification to the Builder.[7]  \n   - **Step 2 (formal claim):** **Written** certified-mail letter describing the defect, sent within the one‑year or sixty‑day warranty period.[4][8][9]  \n\n   Consequences differ depending on what is done:\n\n   - **Late or missing phone call (even if written notice is later timely):**  \n     - Builder is relieved of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages for that emergency.[5][7][10]  \n   - **Correct and prompt phone call, but no timely written claim:**  \n     - The emergency was reported correctly, but the claim still fails because “any claims which have not been made in writing…within [the warranty period] are not covered.”[8][9]  \n   - **Late written claim:**  \n     - Regardless of the phone call, the claim is excluded as untimely.[8][9]  \n\nThe text does not explicitly state different consequences for “late but correct channel” versus “on time but wrong channel,” but because the duty is framed as “must telephone the Builder immediately” and “failure to promptly notify…relieves the Builder of all liability,”[7][10] using the wrong channel or delaying the call both amount to failing the emergency-notification requirement, with the same result: loss of coverage for that emergency.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Channel + timing are both mandatory:**  \n  - Emergencies require **immediate phone notification**;[7] general claims require **timely written notice by certified mail** within the warranty period.[4][8][9]  \n- **Consequences are strict and layered:**  \n  - Missing or delaying the emergency phone call → Builder has **no liability** for replacement, repair, or any damages from that emergency.[5][7][10]  \n  - Missing the written claim deadline → the claim is **not covered at all**, regardless of discoverability or any phone call.[8][9]  \n- **Correct channel is integral to “prompt notification”:**  \n  - Because the contract defines the required emergency channel as telephone, “prompt notification” for emergencies effectively means “prompt phone call.”[7]  \n  - Thus, both delay and use of an incorrect channel can lead to the same consequence: loss of coverage for the emergency event.[5][7][10]  \n\nThe Property Management Agreement and Holding Tank Servicing Contract do not modify or add to these warranty notification rules; they address different relationships and obligations.[1][3]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor an emergency defect under the Builder’s Limited Warranty—such as a burst pipe—the Buyer/Owner is required to **telephone the Builder immediately** at the emergency number; “only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[7] In addition, to preserve any warranty claim, the Buyer/Owner must also submit a **written letter by certified mail, return receipt requested**, within the applicable one‑year or sixty‑day warranty period.[4][8][9] If the Buyer/Owner fails to promptly notify the Builder of the emergency as required (which includes using the specified phone channel), the Builder is **relieved of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages** arising from that emergency.[5][7][10] Separately, any claim not made in writing within the warranty period is not covered at all.[8][9]",

if the buyer/owner delays the phone call the builder is relieved of all liability for that emergency.5710 - if the buyer/owner uses an incorrect channel e.g. only sends a letter or email and does not call that likely fails the requirement to telephone the builder immediately so the builder can argue that the buyer/owner did not promptly notify as required triggering the same consequence no liability.710 3. interaction with written notice requirement - for any warranty claim emergency or not the buyer/owner must also submit a written letter by certified mail within the applicable warranty period.489 therefore for an emergency defect like a burst pipe the full compliance path is: - step 1 emergency: immediate telephone notification to the builder.7 - step 2 formal claim: written certified-mail letter describing the defect sent within the oneyear or sixtyday warranty period.489 consequences differ depending on what is done: - late or missing phone call even if written notice is later timely: - builder is relieved of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages for that emergency.5710 - correct and prompt phone call but no timely written claim: - the emergency was reported correctly but the claim still fails because any claims which have not been made in writingwithin the warranty period are not covered.89 - late written claim: - regardless of the phone call the claim is excluded as untimely.89 the text does not explicitly state different consequences for late but correct channel versus on time but wrong channel but because the duty is framed as must telephone the builder immediately and failure to promptly notifyrelieves the builder of all liability710 using the wrong channel or delaying the call both amount to failing the emergency-notification requirement with the same result: loss of coverage for that emergency.  key connections - channel  timing are both mandatory: - emergencies require immediate phone notification7 general claims require timely written notice by certified mail within the warranty period.489 - consequences are strict and layered: - missing or delaying the emergency phone call  builder has no liability for replacement repair or any damages from that emergency.5710 - missing the written claim deadline  the claim is not covered at all regardless of discoverability or any phone call.89 - correct channel is integral to prompt notification: - because the contract defines the required emergency channel as telephone prompt notification for emergencies effectively means prompt phone call.7 - thus both delay and use of an incorrect channel can lead to the same consequence: loss of coverage for the emergency event.5710 the property management agreement and holding tank servicing contract do not modify or add to these warranty notification rules they address different relationships and obligations.13  conclusion for an emergency defect under the builders limited warrantysuch as a burst pipethe buyer/owner is required to telephone the builder immediately at the emergency number only emergency reports will be taken by phone.7 in addition to preserve any warranty claim the buyer/owner must also submit a written letter by certified mail return receipt requested within the applicable oneyear or sixtyday warranty period.489 if the buyer/owner fails to promptly notify the builder of the emergency as required which includes using the specified phone channel the builder is relieved of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages arising from that emergency.5710 separately any claim not made in writing within the warranty period is not covered at all.89",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Required / permitted notification channels for an emergency defect\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty sets out two different notification mechanisms, depending on whether the issue is an emergency:\n\n- **General (non‑emergency) defects**  \n  - The owner “must…write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder's office address” before the end of the applicable warranty period.[8][12]  \n  - This written, certified‑mail letter is the only specified channel for ordinary warranty claims.[8][12][13]\n\n- **Emergency defects (e.g., burst pipe)**  \n  - “If an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately.”[11]  \n  - “Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[8][11]  \n\nThus, for an emergency such as a burst pipe, the **required notification channel is a telephone call to the Builder** at the listed emergency number.[8][11] Email, online portals, or general written notice are not mentioned as acceptable emergency channels; the contract is explicit that emergency reports are by phone only.[8][11]\n\n### 2. Time frame / deadline for emergency notification\n\nThe warranty uses two different timing concepts:\n\n- **Overall warranty period for any claim**  \n  - Claims must be made in writing within the applicable warranty term:  \n    - One year for major systems and structural components.[1][19][21]  \n    - Sixty days for specified items like doors, windows, switches, etc.[1][21]  \n  - “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.”[12]  \n  - Exclusion J reiterates: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.”[13][16]\n\n- **Prompt notification requirement for emergencies**  \n  - For emergencies, the owner “must telephone the Builder immediately.”[11]  \n  - The contract then states: “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[9][11][14]  \n\nWhile no exact number of minutes or hours is given, the standard is **“immediately” and “promptly”** for emergency phone notification.[11][14] Any significant delay in making that phone call risks being treated as a failure to “promptly notify” under the warranty.[11][14]\n\n### 3. Consequences of delayed or improper notification\n\nThe warranty specifies two layers of consequences:\n\n1. **For emergencies (phone notification)**  \n   - “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[9][11][14]  \n   - There is also a general exclusion for “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”[13][16]  \n\n   Together, these provisions mean:\n   - If the owner does not promptly call the Builder about an emergency (like a burst pipe), the Builder is **relieved of all liability** for:\n     - Replacement  \n     - Repair  \n     - “All other damages” related to that emergency.[9][11][14]  \n   - Even if some coverage might otherwise exist, any **additional damage that could have been avoided by prompt notice** is excluded.[13][16]\n\n2. **For failure to use the required written channel within the warranty period**  \n   - Claims not made “in writing as provided herein” within the one‑year or sixty‑day period “are not covered.”[12][13][16]  \n   - Exclusion J: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.”[13][16]  \n\n   This means that even if the owner calls about an emergency, they still must submit the **required written, certified‑mail claim within the applicable warranty period** to preserve coverage.[8][12][13]\n\nSo, delayed or improper notification has two distinct consequences:\n- **Emergency phone notice not prompt** → Builder is relieved of all liability for that emergency and related damages.[9][11][14]  \n- **Written notice not timely or not in the specified form** → The claim is not covered at all under the warranty.[12][13][16]\n\n### 4. Effect on the owner’s warranty remedies (repair, replacement, reimbursement)\n\nThe warranty ties the owner’s remedies directly to compliance with the notification requirements:\n\n- **Remedies available when notice requirements are met**  \n  - If the owner properly reports a covered defect in writing within the warranty period, the Builder “will repair or replace it at no charge to the Buyer/Owner within sixty (60) days” (subject to delays for weather, labor, or materials).[7][17]  \n  - The Builder has “sole discretion to choose between repair or replacement.”[7][17]\n\n- **Effect of delayed emergency notification**  \n  - If the owner fails to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency, the Builder is relieved of “all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[9][11][14]  \n  - This language directly removes the owner’s right to the core warranty remedies (repair or replacement at no charge) for that emergency situation.[7][11][14][17]\n\n- **Effect of failing to use the required written channel within the warranty term**  \n  - Claims not made in writing, by certified mail, within the one‑year or sixty‑day period “are not covered.”[8][12][13]  \n  - If a claim is “not covered,” the Builder has no contractual obligation to repair, replace, or reimburse for that defect.[7][12][13][17]\n\n- **Additional exclusion for avoidable damages**  \n  - The warranty excludes “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”[13][16]  \n  - Even if some part of the defect remains covered, any **incremental damage** that could have been prevented by timely notice is excluded from the owner’s recoverable remedies.[13][16]\n\nIn combination, these provisions mean:\n- **Prompt emergency phone notice + timely written certified‑mail claim** → Owner preserves the right to have the Builder repair or replace the covered defect at no charge.[7][8][11][12][17]  \n- **Delay in emergency phone notice** → Owner loses the right to repair, replacement, and any other damages for that emergency.[9][11][14]  \n- **Failure to send timely written certified‑mail notice** → The claim is outside warranty coverage, so no repair, replacement, or reimbursement obligation exists.[8][12][13]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Channel vs. timing**:  \n  - For emergencies, the **channel** is strictly a phone call (“Only emergency reports will be taken by phone”)[8][11], and the **timing** is “immediately” / “promptly.”[11][14]  \n  - For all warranty claims (including emergencies), the **formal claim** must also be made **in writing by certified mail** within the applicable warranty period.[8][12][13]\n\n- **Notification and coverage are tightly linked**:  \n  - The warranty repeatedly conditions coverage on proper written notice within the warranty term.[8][12][13]  \n  - For emergencies, it adds an extra condition: prompt phone notice, with an explicit forfeiture of all liability if that condition is not met.[9][11][14]\n\n- **Consequences scale with the type of failure**:  \n  - Failure to promptly call in an emergency → complete loss of warranty remedies for that emergency.[9][11][14]  \n  - Failure to send timely written notice → claim is not covered at all.[12][13]  \n  - Even where some coverage remains, any damage that could have been avoided by prompt notice is excluded.[13][16]\n\nThese connections show that the notification channel (phone vs. certified mail) and the timing (immediate vs. within 60 days/1 year) are not procedural details; they are **substantive conditions** on the owner’s right to warranty remedies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor an emergency defect under the Builder’s Limited Warranty—such as a burst pipe—the owner is required to **telephone the Builder immediately**, using the emergency phone number, because “only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[8][11] In addition, to keep the claim within warranty coverage, the owner must also submit a **written description of the defect by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Builder’s office address within the applicable warranty period (60 days or 1 year, depending on the item).**[8][12][13]\n\nIf the owner **delays** in making the required emergency phone call, the warranty states that this “relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages” arising from that emergency.[9][11][14] Separately, if the owner fails to provide the required written certified‑mail notice within the warranty term, the claim “is not covered,” and the Builder has no obligation to repair, replace, or reimburse.[12][13][17] Any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are also excluded from coverage.[13][16]",
            "text_norm": " analysis  1. required / permitted notification channels for an emergency defect the builders limited warranty sets out two different notification mechanisms depending on whether the issue is an emergency: - general nonemergency defects - the owner mustwrite a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the builder at the builders office address before the end of the applicable warranty period.812 - this written certifiedmail letter is the only specified channel for ordinary warranty claims.81213 - emergency defects e.g. burst pipe - if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage for instance a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately.11 - only emergency reports will be taken by phone.811 thus for an emergency such as a burst pipe the required notification channel is a telephone call to the builder at the listed emergency number.811 email online portals or general written notice are not mentioned as acceptable emergency channels the contract is explicit that emergency reports are by phone only.811  2. time frame / deadline for emergency notification the warranty uses two different timing concepts: -

any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered.12 - exclusion j reiterates: any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable.1316 - prompt notification requirement for emergencies - for emergencies the owner must telephone the builder immediately.11 - the contract then states: failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.91114 while no exact number of minutes or hours is given the standard is immediately and promptly for emergency phone notification.1114 any significant delay in making that phone call risks being treated as a failure to promptly notify under the warranty.1114  3. consequences of delayed or improper notification the warranty specifies two layers of consequences: 1. for emergencies phone notification - failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.91114 - there is also a general exclusion for damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.1316 together these provisions mean: - if the owner does not promptly call the builder about an emergency like a burst pipe the builder is relieved of all liability for: - replacement - repair - all other damages related to that emergency.91114 - even if some coverage might otherwise exist any additional damage that could have been avoided by prompt notice is excluded.1316 2. for failure to use the required written channel within the warranty period - claims not made in writing as provided herein within the oneyear or sixtyday period are not covered.121316 - exclusion j: any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable.1316 this means that even if the owner calls about an emergency they still must submit the required written certifiedmail claim within the applicable warranty period to preserve coverage.81213 so delayed or improper notification has two distinct consequences: - emergency phone notice not prompt  builder is relieved of all liability for that emergency and related damages.91114 - written notice not timely or not in the specified form  the claim is not covered at all under the warranty.121316  4. effect on the owners warranty remedies repair replacement reimbursement the warranty ties the owners remedies directly to compliance with the notification requirements: - remedies available when notice requirements are met - if the owner properly reports a covered defect in writing within the warranty period the builder will repair or replace it at no charge to the buyer/owner within sixty 60 days subject to delays for weather labor or materials.717 - the builder has sole discretion to choose between repair or replacement.717 - effect of delayed emergency notification - if the owner fails to promptly notify the builder of an emergency the builder is relieved of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.91114 - this language directly removes the owners right to the core warranty remedies repair or replacement at no charge for that emergency situation.7111417 - effect of failing to use the required written channel within the warranty term - claims not made in writing by certified mail within the oneyear or sixtyday period are not covered.81213 - if a claim is not covered the builder has no contractual obligation to repair replace or reimburse for that defect.7121317 - additional exclusion for avoidable damages - the warranty excludes damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.1316 - even if some part of the defect remains covered any incremental damage that could have been prevented by timely notice is excluded from the owners recoverable remedies.1316 in combination these provisions mean: - prompt emergency phone notice  timely written certifiedmail claim  owner preserves the right to have the builder repair or replace the covered defect at no charge.78111217 - delay in emergency phone notice  owner loses the right to repair replacement and any other damages for that emergency.91114 - failure to send timely written certifiedmail notice  the claim is outside warranty coverage so no repair replacement or reimbursement obligation exists.81213  key connections - channel vs. timing: - for emergencies the channel is strictly a phone call only emergency reports will be taken by phone811 and the timing is immediately / promptly.1114 - for all warranty claims including emergencies the formal claim must also be made in writing by certified mail within the applicable warranty period.81213 - notification and coverage are tightly linked: - the warranty repeatedly conditions coverage on proper written notice within the warranty term.81213 - for emergencies it adds an extra condition: prompt phone notice with an explicit forfeiture of all liability if that condition is not met.91114 - consequences scale with the type of failure: - failure to promptly call in an emergency  complete loss of warranty remedies for that emergency.91114 - failure to send timely written notice  claim is not covered at all.1213 - even where some coverage remains any damage that could have been avoided by prompt notice is excluded.1316 these connections show that the notification channel phone vs. certified mail and the timing immediate vs. within 60 days/1 year are not procedural details they are substantive conditions on the owners right to warranty remedies.  conclusion for an emergency defect under the builders limited warrantysuch as a burst pipethe owner is required to telephone the builder immediately using the emergency phone number because only emergency reports will be taken by phone.811 in addition to keep the claim within warranty coverage the owner must also submit a written description of the defect by certified mail return receipt requested to the builders office address within the applicable warranty period 60 days or 1 year depending on the item.81213 if the owner delays in making the required emergency phone call the warranty states that this relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages arising from that emergency.91114 separately if the owner fails to provide the required written certifiedmail notice within the warranty term the claim is not covered and the builder has no obligation to repair replace or reimburse.121317 any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are also excluded from coverage.1316",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Required / permitted notification channels for an emergency defect\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty sets out two different notification mechanisms, depending on whether the issue is an emergency:\n\n- **General (non‑emergency) defects**  \n  - The owner “must…write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder's office address” before the end of the applicable warranty period.[8][12]  \n  - This written, certified‑mail letter is the only specified channel for ordinary warranty claims.[8][12][13]\n\n- **Emergency defects (e.g., burst pipe)**  \n  - “If an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately.”[11]  \n  - “Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[8][11]  \n\nThus, for an emergency such as a burst pipe, the **required notification channel is a telephone call to the Builder** at the listed emergency number.[8][11] Email, online portals, or general written notice are not mentioned as acceptable emergency channels; the contract is explicit that emergency reports are by phone only.[8][11]\n\n### 2. Time frame / deadline for emergency notification\n\nThe warranty uses two different timing concepts:\n\n- **Overall warranty period for any claim**  \n  - Claims must be made in writing within the applicable warranty term:  \n    - One year for major systems and structural components.[1][19][21]  \n    - Sixty days for specified items like doors, windows, switches, etc.[1][21]  \n  - “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.”[12]  \n  - Exclusion J reiterates: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.”[13][16]\n\n- **Prompt notification requirement for emergencies**  \n  - For emergencies, the owner “must telephone the Builder immediately.”[11]  \n  - The contract then states: “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[9][11][14]  \n\nWhile no exact number of minutes or hours is given, the standard is **“immediately” and “promptly”** for emergency phone notification.[11][14] Any significant delay in making that phone call risks being treated as a failure to “promptly notify” under the warranty.[11][14]\n\n### 3. Consequences of delayed or improper notification\n\nThe warranty specifies two layers of consequences:\n\n1. **For emergencies (phone notification)**  \n   - “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[9][11][14]  \n   - There is also a general exclusion for “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”[13][16]  \n\n   Together, these provisions mean:\n   - If the owner does not promptly call the Builder about an emergency (like a burst pipe), the Builder is **relieved of all liability** for:\n     - Replacement  \n     - Repair  \n     - “All other damages” related to that emergency.[9][11][14]  \n   - Even if some coverage might otherwise exist, any **additional damage that could have been avoided by prompt notice** is excluded.[13][16]\n\n2. **For failure to use the required written channel within the warranty period**  \n   - Claims not made “in writing as provided herein” within the one‑year or sixty‑day period “are not covered.”[12][13][16]  \n   - Exclusion J: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.”[13][16]  \n\n   This means that even if the owner calls about an emergency, they still must submit the **required written, certified‑mail claim within the applicable warranty period** to preserve coverage.[8][12][13]\n\nSo, delayed or improper notification has two distinct consequences:\n- **Emergency phone notice not prompt** → Builder is relieved of all liability for that emergency and related damages.[9][11][14]  \n- **Written notice not timely or not in the specified form** → The claim is not covered at all under the warranty.[12][13][16]\n\n### 4. Effect on the owner’s warranty remedies (repair, replacement, reimbursement)\n\nThe warranty ties the owner’s remedies directly to compliance with the notification requirements:\n\n- **Remedies available when notice requirements are met**  \n  - If the owner properly reports a covered defect in writing within the warranty period, the Builder “will repair or replace it at no charge to the Buyer/Owner within sixty (60) days” (subject to delays for weather, labor, or materials).[7][17]  \n  - The Builder has “sole discretion to choose between repair or replacement.”[7][17]\n\n- **Effect of delayed emergency notification**  \n  - If the owner fails to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency, the Builder is relieved of “all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[9][11][14]  \n  - This language directly removes the owner’s right to the core warranty remedies (repair or replacement at no charge) for that emergency situation.[7][11][14][17]\n\n- **Effect of failing to use the required written channel within the warranty term**  \n  - Claims not made in writing, by certified mail, within the one‑year or sixty‑day period “are not covered.”[8][12][13]  \n  - If a claim is “not covered,” the Builder has no contractual obligation to repair, replace, or reimburse for that defect.[7][12][13][17]\n\n- **Additional exclusion for avoidable damages**  \n  - The warranty excludes “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”[13][16]  \n  - Even if some part of the defect remains covered, any **incremental damage** that could have been prevented by timely notice is excluded from the owner’s recoverable remedies.[13][16]\n\nIn combination, these provisions mean:\n- **Prompt emergency phone notice + timely written certified‑mail claim** → Owner preserves the right to have the Builder repair or replace the covered defect at no charge.[7][8][11][12][17]  \n- **Delay in emergency phone notice** → Owner loses the right to repair, replacement, and any other damages for that emergency.[9][11][14]  \n- **Failure to send timely written certified‑mail notice** → The claim is outside warranty coverage, so no repair, replacement, or reimbursement obligation exists.[8][12][13]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Channel vs. timing**:  \n  - For emergencies, the **channel** is strictly a phone call (“Only emergency reports will be taken by phone”)[8][11], and the **timing** is “immediately” / “promptly.”[11][14]  \n  - For all warranty claims (including emergencies), the **formal claim** must also be made **in writing by certified mail** within the applicable warranty period.[8][12][13]\n\n- **Notification and coverage are tightly linked**:  \n  - The warranty repeatedly conditions coverage on proper written notice within the warranty term.[8][12][13]  \n  - For emergencies, it adds an extra condition: prompt phone notice, with an explicit forfeiture of all liability if that condition is not met.[9][11][14]\n\n- **Consequences scale with the type of failure**:  \n  - Failure to promptly call in an emergency → complete loss of warranty remedies for that emergency.[9][11][14]  \n  - Failure to send timely written notice → claim is not covered at all.[12][13]  \n  - Even where some coverage remains, any damage that could have been avoided by prompt notice is excluded.[13][16]\n\nThese connections show that the notification channel (phone vs. certified mail) and the timing (immediate vs. within 60 days/1 year) are not procedural details; they are **substantive conditions** on the owner’s right to warranty remedies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor an emergency defect under the Builder’s Limited Warranty—such as a burst pipe—the owner is required to **telephone the Builder immediately**, using the emergency phone number, because “only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[8][11] In addition, to keep the claim within warranty coverage, the owner must also submit a **written description of the defect by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Builder’s office address within the applicable warranty period (60 days or 1 year, depending on the item).**[8][12][13]\n\nIf the owner **delays** in making the required emergency phone call, the warranty states that this “relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages” arising from that emergency.[9][11][14] Separately, if the owner fails to provide the required written certified‑mail notice within the warranty term, the claim “is not covered,” and the Builder has no obligation to repair, replace, or reimburse.[12][13][17] Any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are also excluded from coverage.[13][16]",

Required notification channels for an emergency defect (e.g., burst pipe)\n\nThe warranty sets out two different notification methods, depending on whether the issue is an emergency or a non‑emergency:\n\n- **Standard (non‑emergency) defects – written notice by certified mail**  \n  For any defect the Buyer/Owner believes is covered, they “must…write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder's office address” before the warranty period ends.[6][10]  \n\n- **Emergency defects – telephone only**  \n  For emergencies or situations where delay will cause extra damage (explicitly including “for instance, a defective pipe has burst”):  \n  - “If an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately.”[9]  \n  - “Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[6][9]  \n\nThus, for an emergency defect such as a burst pipe, the **required notification channel is an immediate telephone call to the Builder’s emergency number**.[6][9]\n\n### 2. Timeframes or deadlines for using the required channel\n\nThere are two layers of timing requirements:\n\n1. **Overall warranty claim deadline (written notice)**  \n   - The warranty term is one year (or sixty days for certain items) from settlement/occupancy.[2][19]  \n   - “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.”[10]  \n   - Exclusion J reiterates: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.”[11][14]  \n\n   So, **to preserve any warranty claim at all, the Buyer/Owner must send written notice by certified mail within the applicable warranty period**.[6][10][11]\n\n2. **Emergency notification timing (phone)**  \n   - For emergencies, the contract imposes an immediacy requirement:  \n     - “If an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately.”[9]  \n   - The consequence clause is tied to “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty…”[7][12]  \n\n   The contract does not specify a numeric deadline (e.g., hours), but it **requires that the emergency be reported by phone “immediately” and “promptly”**.[9][12]\n\nIn combination, for an emergency like a burst pipe, the Buyer/Owner must:\n- **Call the Builder immediately** to report the emergency.[9]\n- **Also provide written notice by certified mail within the applicable warranty period** to preserve the formal claim.[6][10][11]\n\n### 3. Consequences of delaying use of the required emergency channel\n\nThe warranty expressly states the consequence of failing to promptly use the required emergency channel (telephone):\n\n- “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty **relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages**.”[7][12]  \n\nThis is a broad consequence:\n- It is triggered by failure to **promptly** notify the Builder of an emergency by phone.[9][12]\n- Once triggered, the Builder is relieved of **all liability** for:\n  - Replacement  \n  - Repair  \n  - “All other damages”[7][12]  \n\nSeparately, the exclusions also state that the warranty does not cover:\n- “Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”[11][14]  \n\nSo, even apart from the emergency clause, **any damage that could have been avoided by prompt notice is excluded**.[11][14] For emergencies, the contract goes further and removes **all** liability for replacement, repair, and other damages if prompt emergency notification is not given.[7][12]\n\n### 4. Effect of delayed notification on warranty remedies (repair, replacement, reimbursement, etc.)\n\nThe warranty’s remedies and their conditions are structured as follows:\n\n- **Standard remedy when properly notified**  \n  - Upon receipt of the Buyer/Owner’s **written report of a defect**, if covered, “the Builder will repair or replace it at no charge to the Buyer/Owner within sixty (60) days…”[7][15]  \n  - The Builder has sole discretion to choose between repair or replacement.[7][15]  \n\n- **Conditions precedent to coverage and remedies**  \n  - Claims must be made in writing within the warranty period; otherwise they are “not covered.”[10][11][14]  \n  - Emergency defects must be promptly reported by phone.[9][12]  \n  - Damages avoidable by prompt notification are excluded.[11][14]  \n\n- **Effect of delayed emergency notification**  \n  - The emergency clause is explicit: “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty **relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages**.”[7][12]  \n\nThis means:\n\n1. **For the emergency condition itself (e.g., the burst pipe)**  \n   - If the Buyer/Owner does not promptly call the Builder as required, the Builder is contractually relieved of liability to:\n     - Repair the defective item  \n     - Replace it  \n     - Pay for any associated damages[7][12]  \n\n2. **For damages resulting from the delay**  \n   - Even if some aspect of the defect might otherwise be covered, any “damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder” are excluded.[11][14]  \n\n3. **For overall warranty rights**  \n   - If the Buyer/Owner also fails to send the required written notice within the warranty period, then **the claim itself is not covered at all** (“ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING…ARE NOT COVERED” and exclusion J).[10][11][14]  \n\nIn practical terms, **delayed or missing emergency phone notification can extinguish the Buyer/Owner’s rights to the core warranty remedies (repair, replacement, and related damages) for that emergency**, even if the defect would otherwise fall within the warranty period and scope.[7][10][11][12][14]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Channel + Timing are linked conditions**:  \n  - Non‑emergency: written certified‑mail notice within the warranty period is required for any coverage.[6][10][11]  \n  - Emergency: immediate phone notice is additionally required; only emergency reports are accepted by phone.[6][9]  \n\n- **Emergency clause is stricter than general exclusions**:  \n  - General exclusion K removes coverage only for “damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification.”[11][14]  \n  - The emergency clause goes further and removes **all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages** if prompt emergency notice is not given.[7][12]  \n\n- **Remedies depend on satisfying both notice requirements**:  \n  - The Builder’s obligation to “repair or replace” arises only “upon receipt of the buyer's or owner's written report of a defect” and only if the item is covered.[7][15]  \n  - For emergencies, coverage is additionally conditioned on prompt telephone notice; failure to do so removes the Builder’s liability for the very remedies (repair, replacement, damages) that would otherwise be available.[7][9][12][15]  \n\n- **Burst pipe is expressly treated as an emergency**:  \n  - The text uses “a defective pipe has burst” as the example of an emergency where delay will cause extra damage.[9]  \n  - Thus, the strict emergency notification rule clearly applies to the scenario in the original query.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFor an emergency defect under the Builder’s Limited Warranty—specifically including a burst pipe—the Buyer/Owner is required to **telephone the Builder immediately** to report the emergency; “only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”[6][9] This phone call must be made **promptly**; failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency “relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[7][12] In addition, to preserve any warranty claim at all, the Buyer/Owner must still submit a **written notice by certified mail within the applicable warranty period**.[6][10][11] Delaying or omitting the required emergency phone notification can therefore eliminate the Buyer/Owner’s rights to the core warranty remedies—repair, replacement, and related damages—for that emergency defect.[7][10][11][12][14][15]",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Definition of “confirmed reservations” and provisions that address them\n\nThe Property Management Agreement does **not expressly define** the term “confirmed reservations” anywhere in the text provided. There is no dedicated definition section or clause that states what counts as a “confirmed reservation.” Instead, the term appears only in the clause dealing with termination and sale of the property.  \n\nThe relevant provisions are in the **TERM** section:\n\n- The agreement states that either party may terminate on 60 days’ written notice, and that such termination “does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][7]  \n- Immediately following that, it provides:  \n  > “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent. In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are at least a subset of “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf” that have been finalized/accepted before termination or sale.[5][7]  \n- The operative rule is that **if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations**.[4][6]\n\nThere is no separate clause elsewhere in the agreement that modifies or limits this obligation.\n\n### 2. Obligations of property manager vs. property owner regarding confirmed reservations on termination or sale\n\n**Owner’s obligations**\n\nThe Owner’s obligations regarding confirmed reservations upon termination or sale are explicit:\n\n1. **Honoring confirmed reservations**  \n   - “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]  \n   - This means the Owner must allow guests with confirmed reservations to occupy the property under the terms of those reservations, even after the management agreement ends or ownership changes.\n\n2. **Continuing obligations and expenses incurred by Agent**  \n   - “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n   - This includes obligations arising from rental agreements and reservations that the Agent entered into on the Owner’s behalf before termination.[5][7]  \n   - Practically, this reinforces that the Owner bears the financial and performance responsibility for reservations already booked through the Agent.\n\n3. **Effect of termination on existing rental agreements**  \n   - “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n   - So, even if the management relationship ends, the underlying guest rental contracts remain valid and enforceable against the Owner.\n\n4. **Binding on successors and assigns**  \n   - The agreement states it “shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[8][12][16]  \n   - When combined with the obligation to honor confirmed reservations on sale, this supports the view that a buyer/successor is expected to take the property subject to those reservations.[4][6][8]\n\n**Agent’s obligations**\n\nThe agreement does **not** set out any special, post-termination duties for the Agent specifically tied to confirmed reservations. The Agent’s listed responsibilities focus on:\n\n- Advertising, renting, and managing the unit during the term (e.g., advertising, collecting rents, contracting for services).[11][10]  \n- There is no clause that says the Agent must relocate guests, cancel reservations, or provide notice to guests after termination or sale.\n\nHowever, during the term:\n\n- The Agent “rent[s], lease[s], operate[s], and manage[s]” the property on the Owner’s behalf.[14][17]  \n- The Agent makes “rental agreements” on the Owner’s behalf, which remain valid even after termination.[5][6][7]\n\nOnce the agreement is terminated, the text shifts responsibility squarely to the Owner to honor those reservations and complete obligations/expenses incurred by the Agent.[4][5][6]\n\n### 3. Financial or other consequences specified for confirmed reservations on termination or sale\n\nThe agreement does not contain a separate, detailed financial mechanism specifically labeled for “confirmed reservations” upon termination or sale. Instead, the consequences are embedded in the general termination language:\n\n1. **Owner must complete obligations and expenses incurred by Agent**  \n   - “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n   - This implies:\n     - The Owner must bear any costs associated with existing reservations (e.g., housekeeping, maintenance, advertising already incurred, and any other expenses tied to those bookings).[10][11]  \n     - The Owner must fulfill the rental obligations (providing occupancy, honoring rates set by Agent, etc.) for those reservations.[5][7]\n\n2. **Agent’s fees and commissions**  \n   - The agreement sets out the Agent’s fee structure (e.g., 25% of gross revenues for short-term rentals, 10% for long-term leases).[13]  \n   - While there is no explicit “post-termination fee” clause, the obligation to complete “all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent”[4][5][6] would reasonably include paying the Agent any earned commissions or fees associated with reservations booked before termination.\n\n3. **Effect of sale**  \n   - The same clause applies “in the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold,” requiring the Owner to honor all confirmed reservations.[4][6]  \n   - The agreement does not separately spell out how revenue from those reservations is handled after a sale, but the binding-on-successors clause suggests that obligations under the agreement, including honoring reservations, follow the property to successors/assigns.[8][12][16]\n\nThere are no explicit penalty, liquidated damages, or special compensation provisions tied solely to confirmed reservations in the event of termination or sale.\n\n### 4. Notice, communication, or guest-relocation procedures for confirmed reservations\n\nThe agreement is **silent** on any special notice, communication, or guest-relocation procedures specifically for handling confirmed reservations when the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.\n\nThe only notice-related provisions are:\n\n- **Termination notice between Owner and Agent**  \n  - “Either party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement.”[5][7][17]  \n  - This is notice between Owner and Agent, not to guests.\n\n- **Notice of listing/sale to Agent**  \n  - The Owner must “provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale. And to notify Agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.”[9][18]  \n  - Again, this is about Owner–Agent communication and access, not guest notification or relocation.\n\nThere is:\n\n- No clause requiring the Agent or Owner to notify guests of the termination of the management agreement.  \n- No clause requiring relocation of guests to other properties.  \n- No clause specifying how or when guests must be informed if the property is sold.\n\nInstead, the contract addresses guest interests indirectly by:\n\n- Keeping existing rental agreements valid despite termination.[5][6][7]  \n- Requiring the Owner to honor all confirmed reservations if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.[4][6]\n\nThus, the protection for guests is contractual continuity (their reservations remain valid and must be honored), rather than a detailed procedural framework for notice or relocation.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Definition vs. effect**: Although “confirmed reservations” is not defined, the agreement clearly states what must happen to them: they must be honored by the Owner if the management agreement ends or the property is sold.[4][6] This connects sub-question 1 (definition/provisions) with sub-question 3 (consequences).\n\n- **Owner vs. Agent responsibilities**:  \n  - The Agent’s role is to create rental agreements and manage the property during the term.[11][14][17]  \n  - The Owner’s role is to stand behind those agreements, especially after termination or sale, by honoring confirmed reservations and completing obligations/expenses incurred by the Agent.[4][5][6]  \n  This addresses sub-question 2 and shows that post-termination responsibility shifts to the Owner.\n\n- **Termination and sale treated similarly**:  \n  - The same clause covers both scenarios: “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]  \n  - Thus, whether the management relationship ends or the property changes hands, the treatment of confirmed reservations is the same: they remain in force and must be honored.\n\n- **Notice and guest procedures**:  \n  - The agreement has notice requirements between Owner and Agent (60-day termination notice; 5-day notice of listing for sale)[5][7][9][17][18] but none directed to guests.  \n  - Instead of procedural detail, the contract uses a substantive rule: existing rental agreements remain valid and confirmed reservations must be honored.[4][5][6][7]  \n  This connects sub-question 4 back to the core obligation identified in sub-questions 1–3.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold:\n\n- **Existing rental agreements made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf remain valid and are not invalidated by termination.**[5][6][7]  \n- **The Owner must honor all confirmed reservations**, meaning guests with confirmed bookings retain their right to stay under the terms of those reservations, even after termination of the management agreement or sale of the property.[4][6]  \n- **The Owner remains responsible for completing all obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent**, which includes obligations arising from those reservations and any associated costs or commissions.[4][5][6][13]  \n- The agreement does **not** specify special guest notice or relocation procedures; instead, it protects guests by ensuring their reservations and rental agreements continue to be honored despite termination or sale.[4][5][6][7]",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Definition of “confirmed reservations” and provisions that address them\n\nThe Property Management Agreement does **not expressly define** the term “confirmed reservations” anywhere in the text provided. There is no dedicated definition section or clause that states what counts as a “confirmed reservation.” Instead, the term appears only in the clause dealing with termination and sale of the property.  \n\nThe relevant provisions are in the **TERM** section:\n\n- The agreement states that either party may terminate on 60 days’ written notice, and that such termination “does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][7]  \n- Immediately following that, it provides:  \n  > “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent. In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are at least a subset of “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf” that have been finalized/accepted before termination or sale.[5][7]  \n- The operative rule is that **if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations**.[4][6]\n\nThere is no separate clause elsewhere in the agreement that modifies or limits this obligation.\n\n### 2. Obligations of property manager vs. property owner regarding confirmed reservations on termination or sale\n\n**Owner’s obligations**\n\nThe Owner’s obligations regarding confirmed reservations upon termination or sale are explicit:\n\n1. **Honoring confirmed reservations**  \n   - “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]  \n   - This means the Owner must allow guests with confirmed reservations to occupy the property under the terms of those reservations, even after the management agreement ends or ownership changes.\n\n2. **Continuing obligations and expenses incurred by Agent**  \n   - “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n   - This includes obligations arising from rental agreements and reservations that the Agent entered into on the Owner’s behalf before termination.[5][7]  \n   - Practically, this reinforces that the Owner bears the financial and performance responsibility for reservations already booked through the Agent.\n\n3. **Effect of termination on existing rental agreements**  \n   - “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n   - So, even if the management relationship ends, the underlying guest rental contracts remain valid and enforceable against the Owner.\n\n4. **Binding on successors and assigns**  \n   - The agreement states it “shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[8][12][16]  \n   - When combined with the obligation to honor confirmed reservations on sale, this supports the view that a buyer/successor is expected to take the property subject to those reservations.[4][6][8]\n\n**Agent’s obligations**\n\nThe agreement does **not** set out any special, post-termination duties for the Agent specifically tied to confirmed reservations. The Agent’s listed responsibilities focus on:\n\n- Advertising, renting, and managing the unit during the term (e.g., advertising, collecting rents, contracting for services).[11][10]  \n- There is no clause that says the Agent must relocate guests, cancel reservations, or provide notice to guests after termination or sale.\n\nHowever, during the term:\n\n- The Agent “rent[s], lease[s], operate[s], and manage[s]” the property on the Owner’s behalf.[14][17]  \n- The Agent makes “rental agreements” on the Owner’s behalf, which remain valid even after termination.[5][6][7]\n\nOnce the agreement is terminated, the text shifts responsibility squarely to the Owner to honor those reservations and complete obligations/expenses incurred by the Agent.[4][5][6]\n\n### 3. Financial or other consequences specified for confirmed reservations on termination or sale\n\nThe agreement does not contain a separate, detailed financial mechanism specifically labeled for “confirmed reservations” upon termination or sale. Instead, the consequences are embedded in the general termination language:\n\n1. **Owner must complete obligations and expenses incurred by Agent**  \n   - “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n   - This implies:\n     - The Owner must bear any costs associated with existing reservations (e.g., housekeeping, maintenance, advertising already incurred, and any other expenses tied to those bookings).[10][11]  \n     - The Owner must fulfill the rental obligations (providing occupancy, honoring rates set by Agent, etc.) for those reservations.[5][7]\n\n2. **Agent’s fees and commissions**  \n   - The agreement sets out the Agent’s fee structure (e.g., 25% of gross revenues for short-term rentals, 10% for long-term leases).[13]  \n   - While there is no explicit “post-termination fee” clause, the obligation to complete “all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent”[4][5][6] would reasonably include paying the Agent any earned commissions or fees associated with reservations booked before termination.\n\n3. **Effect of sale**  \n   - The same clause applies “in the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold,” requiring the Owner to honor all confirmed reservations.[4][6]  \n   - The agreement does not separately spell out how revenue from those reservations is handled after a sale, but the binding-on-successors clause suggests that obligations under the agreement, including honoring reservations, follow the property to successors/assigns.[8][12][16]\n\nThere are no explicit penalty, liquidated damages, or special compensation provisions tied solely to confirmed reservations in the event of termination or sale.\n\n### 4. Notice, communication, or guest-relocation procedures for confirmed reservations\n\nThe agreement is **silent** on any special notice, communication, or guest-relocation procedures specifically for handling confirmed reservations when the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.\n\nThe only notice-related provisions are:\n\n- **Termination notice between Owner and Agent**  \n  - “Either party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement.”[5][7][17]  \n  - This is notice between Owner and Agent, not to guests.\n\n- **Notice of listing/sale to Agent**  \n  - The Owner must “provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale. And to notify Agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.”[9][18]  \n  - Again, this is about Owner–Agent communication and access, not guest notification or relocation.\n\nThere is:\n\n- No clause requiring the Agent or Owner to notify guests of the termination of the management agreement.  \n- No clause requiring relocation of guests to other properties.  \n- No clause specifying how or when guests must be informed if the property is sold.\n\nInstead, the contract addresses guest interests indirectly by:\n\n- Keeping existing rental agreements valid despite termination.[5][6][7]  \n- Requiring the Owner to honor all confirmed reservations if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.[4][6]\n\nThus, the protection for guests is contractual continuity (their reservations remain valid and must be honored), rather than a detailed procedural framework for notice or relocation.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Definition vs. effect**: Although “confirmed reservations” is not defined, the agreement clearly states what must happen to them: they must be honored by the Owner if the management agreement ends or the property is sold.[4][6] This connects sub-question 1 (definition/provisions) with sub-question 3 (consequences).\n\n- **Owner vs. Agent responsibilities**:  \n  - The Agent’s role is to create rental agreements and manage the property during the term.[11][14][17]  \n  - The Owner’s role is to stand behind those agreements, especially after termination or sale, by honoring confirmed reservations and completing obligations/expenses incurred by the Agent.[4][5][6]  \n  This addresses sub-question 2 and shows that post-termination responsibility shifts to the Owner.\n\n- **Termination and sale treated similarly**:  \n  - The same clause covers both scenarios: “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]  \n  - Thus, whether the management relationship ends or the property changes hands, the treatment of confirmed reservations is the same: they remain in force and must be honored.\n\n- **Notice and guest procedures**:  \n  - The agreement has notice requirements between Owner and Agent (60-day termination notice; 5-day notice of listing for sale)[5][7][9][17][18] but none directed to guests.  \n  - Instead of procedural detail, the contract uses a substantive rule: existing rental agreements remain valid and confirmed reservations must be honored.[4][5][6][7]  \n  This connects sub-question 4 back to the core obligation identified in sub-questions 1–3.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold:\n\n- **Existing rental agreements made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf remain valid and are not invalidated by termination.**[5][6][7]  \n- **The Owner must honor all confirmed reservations**, meaning guests with confirmed bookings retain their right to stay under the terms of those reservations, even after termination of the management agreement or sale of the property.[4][6]  \n- **The Owner remains responsible for completing all obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent**, which includes obligations arising from those reservations and any associated costs or commissions.[4][5][6][13]  \n- The agreement does **not** specify special guest notice or relocation procedures; instead, it protects guests by ensuring their reservations and rental agreements continue to be honored despite termination or sale.[4][5][6][7]",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Definition of “confirmed reservations” and provisions on termination/sale\n\nThe Property Management Agreement does not expressly define the term “confirmed reservations” anywhere in the text.[1][4][6][14][17] There is also no separate definitions section that clarifies this term. Based on the structure of the agreement, “confirmed reservations” must be understood in context with “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf.”[5][6][7]\n\nThe key operative provisions are in the TERM clause:\n\n- The agreement can be terminated by either party on 60 days’ written notice.[7][17]  \n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nFrom these provisions, “confirmed reservations” are functionally treated as rental agreements or bookings that have already been made/accepted by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf before termination or sale.[5][6] The agreement does not distinguish between “confirmed reservations” and “existing rental agreements,” and it explicitly states that termination does not invalidate those existing rental agreements.[5][6][7]\n\nThus, the operative rule is: if the management agreement ends or the property is sold, any reservations that have already been confirmed (i.e., existing rental agreements/booking commitments) remain valid and must be honored by the Owner.[4][6]\n\n### 2. Obligations of Owner and Agent regarding confirmed reservations on termination/sale\n\n**Owner’s obligations**\n\nThe Owner’s obligations are stated directly in the TERM clause:\n\n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nThis means:\n\n- The Owner must fulfill (“honor”) all confirmed reservations that were made before termination or sale, even though the management agreement itself has ended or the property has changed hands.[4][6]  \n- The Owner remains responsible for obligations and expenses that the Agent incurred under the agreement, which would include obligations arising from those confirmed reservations (e.g., providing the property as booked, paying for services already contracted for those stays).[4][5][6]\n\nAdditionally, the Owner must notify the Agent if the property is for sale:\n\n- The Owner must “provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale. And to notify Agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.”[9][18]\n\nWhile this clause does not mention reservations explicitly, it supports the transition context: the Owner must keep the Agent informed about a sale so that the Agent’s booking activity and access arrangements can be coordinated with the sale process.[9][18] This is consistent with the Owner’s obligation to ensure that confirmed reservations can still be honored after a sale.[4][6]\n\n**Agent’s obligations**\n\nThe agreement is explicit about the Agent’s responsibilities during the term (advertising, collecting rents, contracting for services, etc.), but it does not set out a separate, detailed set of obligations for the Agent specifically tied to confirmed reservations after termination or sale.[11][10]\n\nThe relevant points are:\n\n- During the term, the Agent “collect[s] all rents for property and deposit[s] same in a special trust account” and provides monthly statements and distributions to the Owner.[10]  \n- The Agent contracts for housekeeping and maintenance on the Owner’s behalf.[10]  \n- These obligations are undertaken “on Owner’s behalf,” and upon termination the Owner “shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]\n\nThe agreement does not say that the Agent must continue to manage or service reservations after termination; instead, it shifts responsibility to the Owner to complete obligations that arose while the Agent was acting.[4][5][6] In other words:\n\n- The Agent’s role in relation to confirmed reservations is primarily to have created them (as “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf”).[5][6][7]  \n- Once the agreement is terminated, the Owner is the party explicitly obligated to honor those reservations and to complete any related obligations or expenses.[4][5][6]\n\nThere is no clause requiring the Agent to cancel, modify, or otherwise manage confirmed reservations after termination; the contract simply preserves the validity of those reservations and places the duty to honor them on the Owner.[4][5][6]\n\n### 3. Financial responsibility for refunds, penalties, or compensation\n\nThe agreement does not contain a specific clause that uses the words “refunds,” “penalties,” or “compensation” in connection with confirmed reservations or termination/sale.[1][4][6][13] However, the allocation of responsibility can be inferred from the general obligations:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nBecause:\n\n1. The reservations remain valid rental agreements,[5][6][7] and  \n2. The Owner must honor them and is responsible for obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement,[4][5][6]\n\nit follows that:\n\n- If a confirmed reservation must be fulfilled, the Owner bears the cost of providing the stay and any associated services (housekeeping, maintenance, etc.) that were contracted by the Agent.[4][5][6][10]  \n- If, contrary to the contract, a confirmed reservation is not honored and a refund or compensation is owed to the guest under the rental agreement, that obligation would fall on the Owner, because the Owner is the party who remains responsible for obligations and expenses arising from the Agent’s actions and from those rental agreements.[4][5][6]\n\nThe fee structure confirms that the Agent’s compensation is a commission on gross revenues and certain service fees, all charged to the Owner.[13] There is no provision that shifts guest-related financial liabilities (such as refunds or penalties) to the Agent after termination; instead, the Owner is the one who pays the Agent’s fees and bears the underlying economic risk of the rental activity.[13]\n\nThus, while the agreement does not explicitly spell out “who pays refunds,” the combination of:\n\n- Owner’s continuing responsibility for obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent,[4][5][6] and  \n- Owner’s duty to honor confirmed reservations,[4][6]\n\nmeans that the Owner is financially responsible for the consequences of those reservations, including any refunds or compensation that may arise if they are not properly honored.\n\n### 4. Timelines, notice requirements, and transition procedures for handling confirmed reservations\n\nThe agreement includes general timing and notice provisions, but none that are narrowly tailored to “handling confirmed reservations” as a separate process.\n\nRelevant timing/notice provisions:\n\n- Either party may terminate the agreement “upon sixty (60) days written notice.”[7][17]  \n- Termination “does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n- The Owner must notify the Agent “within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale” and must notify the Agent before authorizing access to the property to anyone.[9][18]\n\nWhat is missing:\n\n- There is no specific timeline for transferring reservation records, guest contact information, or funds related to future stays when the agreement ends.  \n- There is no explicit procedure for how the Owner is to take over management of confirmed reservations (e.g., no requirement that the Agent provide a reservation ledger by a certain date).  \n- There is no special notice requirement to guests in the event of termination or sale.\n\nInstead, the contract handles the transition by:\n\n- Preserving the validity of existing rental agreements,[5][6][7] and  \n- Assigning the obligation to honor those reservations and complete related obligations/expenses to the Owner.[4][5][6]\n\nThe only explicit timing that indirectly affects reservations is the 60‑day termination notice and the 5‑day notice of listing for sale.[7][17][9][18] These provisions ensure that:\n\n- Termination is not abrupt, giving time for the Owner and Agent to coordinate around existing bookings.  \n- The Agent is informed promptly of a sale process, which is important because the Owner must still honor confirmed reservations even if the property is sold.[4][6][9][18]\n\nHowever, beyond these general notice periods, the agreement does not set out detailed transition procedures specifically for confirmed reservations.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Definition and validity**: While “confirmed reservations” is not defined, the agreement clearly states that termination does not invalidate existing rental agreements and that the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.[4][5][6][7] This answers both what happens to the reservations (they remain valid) and who must deal with them (the Owner).\n\n- **Obligations vs. financial responsibility**: The Owner’s obligation to honor confirmed reservations[4][6] is directly linked to the Owner’s continuing responsibility for “all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6] Together, these provisions mean the Owner is both operationally and financially responsible for carrying out those reservations, including any associated costs or potential refunds.\n\n- **Agent’s limited post‑termination role**: The Agent’s duties are robust during the term (advertising, collecting rents, contracting for services),[10][11] but the contract does not impose ongoing duties regarding reservations after termination. Instead, the Owner steps into full responsibility for obligations arising from the Agent’s prior actions.[4][5][6] This clarifies that the Agent is not the party expected to manage or pay for issues with confirmed reservations once the agreement ends.\n\n- **Transition mechanics via notice**: The 60‑day termination notice and 5‑day sale‑listing notice[7][17][9][18] provide the temporal framework within which the parties must manage the transition. Although there is no detailed reservation‑transition protocol, these notice periods are the mechanism that allows the Owner and Agent to plan for the continued honoring of confirmed reservations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold, existing “confirmed reservations” (i.e., rental agreements already made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf) remain valid and are not canceled by the termination.[5][6][7] The Owner is expressly required to honor all such confirmed reservations in either scenario and must continue to be responsible for, or cause to be completed, all obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with those reservations.[4][5][6] The agreement does not assign post‑termination reservation obligations or financial liabilities to the Agent, nor does it provide detailed transition procedures beyond the 60‑day termination notice and the Owner’s duty to notify the Agent promptly if the property is listed for sale.[7][17][9][18]",
            "text_norm": " analysis  1. definition of confirmed reservations and provisions on termination/sale the property management agreement does not expressly define the term confirmed reservations anywhere in the text.1461417 there is also no separate definitions section that clarifies this term. based on the structure of the agreement confirmed reservations must be understood in context with existing rental agreements made by agent on owners behalf.567 the key operative provisions are in the term clause: - the agreement can be terminated by either party on 60 days written notice.717 - termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by agent on owners behalf.567 - upon termination owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent.456 - in the event this agreement is terminated or the property is sold the owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.46 from these provisions confirmed reservations are functionally treated as rental agreements or bookings that have already been made/accepted by the agent on the owners behalf before termination or sale.56 the agreement does not distinguish between confirmed reservations and existing rental agreements and it explicitly states that termination does not invalidate those existing rental agreements.567 thus the operative rule is: if the management agreement ends or the property is sold any reservations that have already been confirmed i.e. existing rental agreements/booking commitments remain valid and must be honored by the owner.46  2. obligations of owner and agent regarding confirmed reservations on termination/sale owners obligations the owners obligations are stated directly in the term clause: - upon termination owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent.456 - in the event this agreement is terminated or the property is sold the owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.46 this means: - the owner must fulfill honor all confirmed reservations that were made before termination or sale even though the management agreement itself has ended or the property has changed hands.46 - the owner remains responsible for obligations and expenses that the agent incurred under the agreement which would include obligations arising from those confirmed reservations e.g. providing the property as booked paying for services already contracted for those stays.456 additionally the owner must notify the agent if the property is for sale: - the owner must provide agent with written notification within five 5 business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale. and to notify agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.918 while this clause does not mention reservations explicitly it supports the transition context: the owner must keep the agent informed about a sale so that the agents booking activity and access arrangements can be coordinated with the sale process.918 this is consistent with the owners obligation to ensure that confirmed reservations can still be honored after a sale.46 agents obligations the agreement is explicit about the agents responsibilities during the term advertising collecting rents contracting for services etc. but it does not set out a separate detailed set of obligations for the agent specifically tied to confirmed reservations after termination or sale.1110 the relevant points are: - during the term the agent collects all rents for property and deposits same in a special trust account and provides monthly statements and distributions to the owner.10 - the agent contracts for housekeeping and maintenance on the owners behalf.10 - these obligations are undertaken on owners behalf and upon termination the owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent.456 the agreement does not say that the agent must continue to manage or service reservations after termination instead it shifts responsibility to the owner to complete obligations that arose while the agent was acting.456 in other words: - the agents role in relation to confirmed reservations is primarily to have created them as existing rental agreements made by agent on owners behalf.567 - once the agreement is terminated the owner is the party explicitly obligated to honor those reservations and to complete any related obligations or expenses.456 there is no clause requiring the agent to cancel modify or otherwise manage confirmed reservations after termination the contract simply preserves the validity of those reservations and places the duty to honor them on the owner.456  3. financial responsibility for refunds penalties or compensation the agreement does not contain a specific clause that uses the words refunds penalties or compensation in connection with confirmed reservations or termination/sale.14613 however the allocation of responsibility can be inferred from the general obligations: - termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by agent on owners behalf.567 - upon termination owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent.456 - in the event this agreement is terminated or the property is sold the owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.46 because: 1. the reservations remain valid rental agreements567 and 2. the owner must honor them and is responsible for obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement456 it follows that: - if a confirmed reservation must be fulfilled the owner bears the cost of providing the stay and any associated services housekeeping maintenance etc. that were contracted by the agent.45610 - if contrary to the contract a confirmed reservation is not honored and a refund or compensation is owed to the guest under the rental agreement that obligation would fall on the owner because the owner is the party who remains responsible for obligations and expenses arising from the agents actions and from those rental agreements.456 the fee structure confirms that the agents compensation is a commission on gross revenues and certain service fees all charged to the owner.13 there is no provision that shifts guest-related financial liabilities such as refunds or penalties to the agent after termination instead the owner is the one who pays the agents fees and bears the underlying economic risk of the rental activity.13 thus while the agreement does not explicitly spell out who pays refunds the combination of: - owners continuing responsibility for obligations and expenses incurred by the agent456 and - owners duty to honor confirmed reservations46 means that the owner is financially responsible for the consequences of those reservations including any refunds or compensation that may arise if they are not properly honored.  4. timelines notice requirements and transition procedures for handling confirmed reservations the agreement includes general timing and notice provisions but none that are narrowly tailored to handling confirmed reservations as a separate process. relevant timing/notice provisions: - either party may terminate the agreement upon sixty 60 days written notice.717 - termination does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by agent on owners behalf.567 - the owner must notify the agent within five 5 business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale and must notify the agent before authorizing access to the property to anyone.918 what is missing: - there is no specific timeline for transferring reservation records guest contact information or funds related to future stays when the agreement ends. - there is no explicit procedure for how the owner is to take over management of confirmed reservations e.g. no requirement that the agent provide a reservation ledger by a certain date. - there is no special notice requirement to guests in the event of termination or sale. instead the contract handles the transition by: - preserving the validity of existing rental agreements567 and - assigning the obligation to honor those reservations and complete related obligations/expenses to the owner.456 the only explicit timing that indirectly affects reservations is the 60day termination notice and the 5day notice of listing for sale.717918 these provisions ensure that: - termination is not abrupt giving time for the owner and agent to coordinate around existing bookings. - the agent is informed promptly of a sale process which is important because the owner must still honor confirmed reservations even if the property is sold.46918 however beyond these general notice periods the agreement does not set out detailed transition procedures specifically for confirmed reservations.  key connections - definition and validity: while confirmed reservations is not defined the agreement clearly states that termination does not invalidate existing rental agreements and that the owner must honor all confirmed reservations if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.4567 this answers both what happens to the reservations they remain valid and who must deal with them the owner. - obligations vs. financial responsibility: the owners obligation to honor confirmed reservations46 is directly linked to the owners continuing responsibility for all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent.456 together these provisions mean the owner is both operationally and financially responsible for carrying out those reservations including any associated costs or potential refunds. - agents limited posttermination role: the agents duties are robust during the term advertising collecting rents contracting for services1011 but the contract does not impose ongoing duties regarding reservations after termination. instead the owner steps into full responsibility for obligations arising from the agents prior actions.456 this clarifies that the agent is not the party expected to manage or pay for issues with confirmed reservations once the agreement ends. - transition mechanics via notice: the 60day termination notice and 5day salelisting notice717918 provide the temporal framework within which the parties must manage the transition. although there is no detailed reservationtransition protocol these notice periods are the mechanism that allows the owner and agent to plan for the continued honoring of confirmed reservations.  conclusion under the property management agreement if the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold existing confirmed reservations i.e. rental agreements already made by the agent on the owners behalf remain valid and are not canceled by the termination.567 the owner is expressly required to honor all such confirmed reservations in either scenario and must continue to be responsible for or cause to be completed all obligations and expenses incurred by the agent in connection with those reservations.456 the agreement does not assign posttermination reservation obligations or financial liabilities to the agent nor does it provide detailed transition procedures beyond the 60day termination notice and the owners duty to notify the agent promptly if the property is listed for sale.717918",

Although there is no detailed reservation‑transition protocol, these notice periods are the mechanism that allows the Owner and Agent to plan for the continued honoring of confirmed reservations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold, existing “confirmed reservations” (i.e., rental agreements already made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf) remain valid and are not canceled by the termination.[5][6][7] The Owner is expressly required to honor all such confirmed reservations in either scenario and must continue to be responsible for, or cause to be completed, all obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with those reservations.[4][5][6] The agreement does not assign post‑termination reservation obligations or financial liabilities to the Agent, nor does it provide detailed transition procedures beyond the 60‑day termination notice and the Owner’s duty to notify the Agent promptly if the property is listed for sale.[7][17][9][18]",

Definition and conditions/timeframes for “confirmed reservations”\n\nThe Property Management Agreement does **not** expressly define the term “confirmed reservation” (no clause provides a specific definition or special timing rules for when a reservation becomes “confirmed”). The operative language appears in the TERM section:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are those rental agreements/reservations that have already been made/accepted by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf before termination or sale.[5][6]  \n- There is **no separate timeframe limitation** stated (e.g., “only those occurring within X days after termination”). The obligation is stated broadly: the Owner “shall honor all confirmed reservations” if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.[4][6]\n\nThus, any reservation that is already in place (i.e., an “existing rental agreement” made by the Agent) at the time of termination or sale is treated as a “confirmed reservation” that must be honored by the Owner.[5][6]\n\n### 2. Handling of confirmed reservations after termination; who is responsible\n\nThe TERM clause governs what happens when the management agreement is terminated:\n\n- Either party may terminate with 60 days’ written notice.[7][17]  \n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated … the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nFrom these provisions:\n\n- **Existing/confirmed reservations survive termination** of the management agreement; they are not canceled by the fact that the Agent’s management authority ends.[5][6][7]\n- After termination, the **Owner** is responsible for:\n  - Completing “all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent”[4][5][6]—which includes obligations arising from reservations the Agent made while the agreement was in force.\n  - Honoring “all confirmed reservations” that were in place at the time of termination.[4][6]\n\nThe agreement does **not** explicitly assign post‑termination operational tasks (e.g., who checks guests in, who cleans, who communicates with guests). It simply shifts legal and financial responsibility to the Owner for obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement and requires the Owner to honor the confirmed reservations.[4][5][6] There is no clause authorizing the Agent to cancel those reservations upon termination; instead, the contract explicitly preserves them.[5][6][7]\n\n### 3. Handling of confirmed reservations if the property is sold; buyer obligations and allocation\n\nThe same key sentence addresses the sale of the property:\n\n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nOther relevant language:\n\n- The Owner must notify the Agent within five business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale and must notify the Agent before authorizing access to the property to anyone.[9][18]\n- The agreement is “binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[8][12][16]\n\nPutting these together:\n\n- If the **property is sold**, the Owner (the party to this agreement) remains contractually obligated under this agreement to ensure that “all confirmed reservations” are honored.[4][6]\n- The agreement does **not** explicitly state that the **buyer** is directly bound to honor the reservations. However:\n  - The contract states it is binding upon “successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[8][12][16] This suggests that if the Owner’s interest and obligations are assigned to a buyer (or the buyer is a successor in a way recognized by the agreement), the buyer could be bound to those obligations, including honoring confirmed reservations.[8][12][16]\n  - Even if the buyer is not directly named, the current Owner remains responsible under this agreement to see that the confirmed reservations are honored, which in practice usually means arranging with the buyer to take subject to those reservations or otherwise fulfilling/compensating them.[4][6]\n\nOn **allocation of obligations or revenues**:\n\n- The agreement clearly states that upon termination, “Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6] This includes obligations tied to reservations (e.g., providing the stay, paying related expenses).\n- The agreement does **not** contain a specific clause that reallocates rental income or expenses between seller and buyer upon sale. It only addresses the relationship between Owner and Agent (e.g., Agent’s commissions, trust account, monthly statements).[10][13]\n- Therefore, as between Owner and Agent:\n  - The Agent’s right to commissions is tied to “gross revenues” from rentals.[13]\n  - The Owner remains responsible for obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement, even after termination.[4][5][6]\n- As between **seller and buyer**, the agreement is silent on how they split revenue or costs for stays that occur after closing; that allocation would need to be handled in the sale documents, but the Owner’s obligation under this agreement is to ensure confirmed reservations are honored.[4][6]\n\n### 4. Notice, disclosure, and guest communication requirements related to confirmed reservations\n\nThe agreement includes some notice and disclosure obligations, but they are limited:\n\n- If the property is for sale, the Owner must:\n  - Provide the Agent with written notification within five business days of a listing agreement.[9][18]\n  - Notify the Agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.[9][18]\n- The agreement also requires 60 days’ written notice for termination of the management agreement.[7][17]\n\nHowever, regarding **confirmed reservations specifically**:\n\n- There is **no explicit clause** requiring:\n  - Notice to guests about termination of the management agreement.\n  - Notice to guests about the sale of the property.\n  - Any particular form of guest communication or disclosure about changes in ownership or management.\n\nThe only explicit obligations tied to confirmed reservations are:\n\n- They are not invalidated by termination of the management agreement.[5][6][7]\n- The Owner must honor all confirmed reservations if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.[4][6]\n\nThe agreement does not specify who must contact guests or what must be communicated to them in these scenarios. Any such communications would be implied by the obligation to honor the reservations but are not spelled out in the contract language.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Definition and scope**: While “confirmed reservation” is not defined, the contract’s protection of “existing rental agreements” and the requirement to honor “all confirmed reservations” show that any reservation already made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf is intended to survive termination or sale.[4][5][6][7]\n- **Survival of reservations**: Termination of the management agreement does not cancel existing rental agreements; instead, those reservations continue, and the Owner remains responsible for fulfilling them.[5][6][7]\n- **Sale vs. termination**: The same operative sentence covers both events—termination and sale—using identical language: in either case, the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations.[4][6] Thus, the treatment of confirmed reservations is consistent across both scenarios.\n- **Responsibility vs. mechanics**: The agreement clearly assigns **responsibility** (the Owner must honor reservations and complete obligations/expenses incurred under the agreement)[4][5][6] but does not detail the operational mechanics (who checks in guests, who communicates with them, etc.) or the financial allocation between seller and buyer upon sale.\n- **Notice and disclosure**: Notice obligations are directed at the relationship between Owner and Agent (notice of sale listing, notice of access, notice of termination)[7][9][17][18], not at guests. There are no explicit guest‑communication requirements tied to confirmed reservations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold, **existing/confirmed reservations are preserved and must be honored**. Termination “does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf,” and in either event—termination or sale—“the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][5][6][7] After termination, the Owner remains responsible for completing all obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement, which includes obligations arising from those reservations.[4][5][6] When the property is sold, the agreement does not expressly impose duties on the buyer, but it is binding on successors and assigns, and the Owner remains contractually obligated to ensure that confirmed reservations are honored.[4][6][8][12][16] The contract contains notice requirements between Owner and Agent regarding sale and termination, but it does not specify any particular notice or communication duties to guests about these events.[7][9][17][18]",

honoring all confirmed reservations that were in place at the time of termination.46 the agreement does not explicitly assign posttermination operational tasks e.g. who checks guests in who cleans who communicates with guests. it simply shifts legal and financial responsibility to the owner for obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement and requires the owner to honor the confirmed reservations.456 there is no clause authorizing the agent to cancel those reservations upon termination instead the contract explicitly preserves them.567  3. handling of confirmed reservations if the property is sold buyer obligations and allocation the same key sentence addresses the sale of the property: - in the event this agreement is terminated or the property is sold the owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.46 other relevant language: - the owner must notify the agent within five business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale and must notify the agent before authorizing access to the property to anyone.918 - the agreement is binding upon the successors and assigns of owner or agent.81216 putting these together: - if the property is sold the owner the party to this agreement remains contractually obligated under this agreement to ensure that all confirmed reservations are honored.46 - the agreement does not explicitly state that the buyer is directly bound to honor the reservations. however: - the contract states it is binding upon successors and assigns of owner or agent.81216 this suggests that if the owners interest and obligations are assigned to a buyer or the buyer is a successor in a way recognized by the agreement the buyer could be bound to those obligations including honoring confirmed reservations.81216 - even if the buyer is not directly named the current owner remains responsible under this agreement to see that the confirmed reservations are honored which in practice usually means arranging with the buyer to take subject to those reservations or otherwise fulfilling/compensating them.46 on allocation of obligations or revenues: - the agreement clearly states that upon termination owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the agent.456 this includes obligations tied to reservations e.g. providing the stay paying related expenses. - the agreement does not contain a specific clause that reallocates rental income or expenses between seller and buyer upon sale. it only addresses the relationship between owner and agent e.g. agents commissions trust account monthly statements.1013 - therefore as between owner and agent: - the agents right to commissions is tied to gross revenues from rentals.13 - the owner remains responsible for obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement even after termination.456 - as between seller and buyer the agreement is silent on how they split revenue or costs for stays that occur after closing that allocation would need to be handled in the sale documents but the owners obligation under this agreement is to ensure confirmed reservations are honored.46  4. notice disclosure and guest communication requirements related to confirmed reservations the agreement includes some notice and disclosure obligations but they are limited: - if the property is for sale the owner must: - provide the agent with written notification within five business days of a listing agreement.918 - notify the agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.918 - the agreement also requires 60 days written notice for termination of the management agreement.717 however regarding confirmed reservations specifically: - there is no explicit clause requiring: - notice to guests about termination of the management agreement. - notice to guests about the sale of the property. - any particular form of guest communication or disclosure about changes in ownership or management. the only explicit obligations tied to confirmed reservations are: - they are not invalidated by termination of the management agreement.567 - the owner must honor all confirmed reservations if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.46 the agreement does not specify who must contact guests or what must be communicated to them in these scenarios. any such communications would be implied by the obligation to honor the reservations but are not spelled out in the contract language.  key connections - definition and scope: while confirmed reservation is not defined the contracts protection of existing rental agreements and the requirement to honor all confirmed reservations show that any reservation already made by the agent on the owners behalf is intended to survive termination or sale.4567 - survival of reservations: termination of the management agreement does not cancel existing rental agreements instead those reservations continue and the owner remains responsible for fulfilling them.567 - sale vs. termination: the same operative sentence covers both eventstermination and saleusing identical language: in either case the owner must honor all confirmed reservations.46 thus the treatment of confirmed reservations is consistent across both scenarios. - responsibility vs. mechanics: the agreement clearly assigns responsibility the owner must honor reservations and complete obligations/expenses incurred under the agreement456 but does not detail the operational mechanics who checks in guests who communicates with them etc. or the financial allocation between seller and buyer upon sale. - notice and disclosure: notice obligations are directed at the relationship between owner and agent notice of sale listing notice of access notice of termination791718 not at guests. there are no explicit guestcommunication requirements tied to confirmed reservations.  conclusion under the property management agreement if the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold existing/confirmed reservations are preserved and must be honored. termination does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by agent on owners behalf and in either eventtermination or salethe owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.4567 after termination the owner remains responsible for completing all obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement which includes obligations arising from those reservations.456 when the property is sold the agreement does not expressly impose duties on the buyer but it is binding on successors and assigns and the owner remains contractually obligated to ensure that confirmed reservations are honored.4681216 the contract contains notice requirements between owner and agent regarding sale and termination but it does not specify any particular notice or communication duties to guests about these events.791718",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Definition and conditions/timeframes for “confirmed reservations”\n\nThe Property Management Agreement does **not** expressly define the term “confirmed reservation” (no clause provides a specific definition or special timing rules for when a reservation becomes “confirmed”). The operative language appears in the TERM section:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are those rental agreements/reservations that have already been made/accepted by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf before termination or sale.[5][6]  \n- There is **no separate timeframe limitation** stated (e.g., “only those occurring within X days after termination”). The obligation is stated broadly: the Owner “shall honor all confirmed reservations” if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.[4][6]\n\nThus, any reservation that is already in place (i.e., an “existing rental agreement” made by the Agent) at the time of termination or sale is treated as a “confirmed reservation” that must be honored by the Owner.[5][6]\n\n### 2. Handling of confirmed reservations after termination; who is responsible\n\nThe TERM clause governs what happens when the management agreement is terminated:\n\n- Either party may terminate with 60 days’ written notice.[7][17]  \n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.”[5][6][7]  \n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6]  \n- “In the event this agreement is terminated … the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nFrom these provisions:\n\n- **Existing/confirmed reservations survive termination** of the management agreement; they are not canceled by the fact that the Agent’s management authority ends.[5][6][7]\n- After termination, the **Owner** is responsible for:\n  - Completing “all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent”[4][5][6]—which includes obligations arising from reservations the Agent made while the agreement was in force.\n  - Honoring “all confirmed reservations” that were in place at the time of termination.[4][6]\n\nThe agreement does **not** explicitly assign post‑termination operational tasks (e.g., who checks guests in, who cleans, who communicates with guests). It simply shifts legal and financial responsibility to the Owner for obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement and requires the Owner to honor the confirmed reservations.[4][5][6] There is no clause authorizing the Agent to cancel those reservations upon termination; instead, the contract explicitly preserves them.[5][6][7]\n\n### 3. Handling of confirmed reservations if the property is sold; buyer obligations and allocation\n\nThe same key sentence addresses the sale of the property:\n\n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][6]\n\nOther relevant language:\n\n- The Owner must notify the Agent within five business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale and must notify the Agent before authorizing access to the property to anyone.[9][18]\n- The agreement is “binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[8][12][16]\n\nPutting these together:\n\n- If the **property is sold**, the Owner (the party to this agreement) remains contractually obligated under this agreement to ensure that “all confirmed reservations” are honored.[4][6]\n- The agreement does **not** explicitly state that the **buyer** is directly bound to honor the reservations. However:\n  - The contract states it is binding upon “successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[8][12][16] This suggests that if the Owner’s interest and obligations are assigned to a buyer (or the buyer is a successor in a way recognized by the agreement), the buyer could be bound to those obligations, including honoring confirmed reservations.[8][12][16]\n  - Even if the buyer is not directly named, the current Owner remains responsible under this agreement to see that the confirmed reservations are honored, which in practice usually means arranging with the buyer to take subject to those reservations or otherwise fulfilling/compensating them.[4][6]\n\nOn **allocation of obligations or revenues**:\n\n- The agreement clearly states that upon termination, “Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.”[4][5][6] This includes obligations tied to reservations (e.g., providing the stay, paying related expenses).\n- The agreement does **not** contain a specific clause that reallocates rental income or expenses between seller and buyer upon sale. It only addresses the relationship between Owner and Agent (e.g., Agent’s commissions, trust account, monthly statements).[10][13]\n- Therefore, as between Owner and Agent:\n  - The Agent’s right to commissions is tied to “gross revenues” from rentals.[13]\n  - The Owner remains responsible for obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement, even after termination.[4][5][6]\n- As between **seller and buyer**, the agreement is silent on how they split revenue or costs for stays that occur after closing; that allocation would need to be handled in the sale documents, but the Owner’s obligation under this agreement is to ensure confirmed reservations are honored.[4][6]\n\n### 4. Notice, disclosure, and guest communication requirements related to confirmed reservations\n\nThe agreement includes some notice and disclosure obligations, but they are limited:\n\n- If the property is for sale, the Owner must:\n  - Provide the Agent with written notification within five business days of a listing agreement.[9][18]\n  - Notify the Agent prior to authorizing access to the property to anyone.[9][18]\n- The agreement also requires 60 days’ written notice for termination of the management agreement.[7][17]\n\nHowever, regarding **confirmed reservations specifically**:\n\n- There is **no explicit clause** requiring:\n  - Notice to guests about termination of the management agreement.\n  - Notice to guests about the sale of the property.\n  - Any particular form of guest communication or disclosure about changes in ownership or management.\n\nThe only explicit obligations tied to confirmed reservations are:\n\n- They are not invalidated by termination of the management agreement.[5][6][7]\n- The Owner must honor all confirmed reservations if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold.[4][6]\n\nThe agreement does not specify who must contact guests or what must be communicated to them in these scenarios. Any such communications would be implied by the obligation to honor the reservations but are not spelled out in the contract language.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Definition and scope**: While “confirmed reservation” is not defined, the contract’s protection of “existing rental agreements” and the requirement to honor “all confirmed reservations” show that any reservation already made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf is intended to survive termination or sale.[4][5][6][7]\n- **Survival of reservations**: Termination of the management agreement does not cancel existing rental agreements; instead, those reservations continue, and the Owner remains responsible for fulfilling them.[5][6][7]\n- **Sale vs. termination**: The same operative sentence covers both events—termination and sale—using identical language: in either case, the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations.[4][6] Thus, the treatment of confirmed reservations is consistent across both scenarios.\n- **Responsibility vs. mechanics**: The agreement clearly assigns **responsibility** (the Owner must honor reservations and complete obligations/expenses incurred under the agreement)[4][5][6] but does not detail the operational mechanics (who checks in guests, who communicates with them, etc.) or the financial allocation between seller and buyer upon sale.\n- **Notice and disclosure**: Notice obligations are directed at the relationship between Owner and Agent (notice of sale listing, notice of access, notice of termination)[7][9][17][18], not at guests. There are no explicit guest‑communication requirements tied to confirmed reservations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold, **existing/confirmed reservations are preserved and must be honored**. Termination “does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf,” and in either event—termination or sale—“the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.”[4][5][6][7] After termination, the Owner remains responsible for completing all obligations and expenses incurred under the agreement, which includes obligations arising from those reservations.[4][5][6] When the property is sold, the agreement does not expressly impose duties on the buyer, but it is binding on successors and assigns, and the Owner remains contractually obligated to ensure that confirmed reservations are honored.[4][6][8][12][16] The contract contains notice requirements between Owner and Agent regarding sale and termination, but it does not specify any particular notice or communication duties to guests about these events.[7][9][17][18]",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\nBelow, I walk through the sub‑questions in order, using only **explicitly stated day‑based time windows** (i.e., periods expressed in days, such as “60 days,” “10 business days,” “less than 180 days,” etc.), and then synthesize them.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identify all explicitly stated day‑based time windows\n\nFrom the **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**:\n\n1. **Sixty (60) days – defect‑free coverage for certain items**  \n   - “The Builder warrants that … for a period of sixty (60) days that the following items will be free of defects in materials or workmanship: doors … windows, electric switches, receptacles, and fixtures; caulking around exterior openings, plumbing fixtures and cabinet work.” [1], [8], [18]  \n   - This is a 60‑day warranty window for specified non‑structural items.\n\n2. **One (1) year – defect‑free coverage for structural and major systems**  \n   - “The Builder warrants for a period of one (1) year that … floors, ceilings, walls, and other internal structural components … the plumbing … heating, and electric wiring systems; and the roof will be free of defects in materials or workmanship.” [11], [18]  \n   - This is a 1‑year warranty window for structural and major systems.\n\n3. **Termination of warranty: one (1) year or sixty (60) days after commencement**  \n   - “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement.” [5], [8], [10], [18]  \n   - This defines the overall duration of each coverage type (1‑year or 60‑day) from the start date.\n\n4. **Claim‑filing deadline: within one (1) year or sixty (60) days**  \n   - “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [5], [10], [18]  \n   - “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.” [4], [18]  \n   - This is a hard deadline for written claims, matching the applicable warranty period.\n\n5. **Notification deadline for defects: prior to termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day period**  \n   - “If Buyer/Owner believes a defect is covered … the Buyer/Owner must, prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable, write a letter describing the defect…” [6], [18]  \n   - This restates the claim‑filing window in operational terms.\n\n6. **Repair completion window: within sixty (60) days**  \n   - “The Builder will repair or replace it at no charge … within sixty (60) days (longer if weather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages cause delays).” [7], [18]  \n   - This is a 60‑day performance window for the Builder to complete repairs/replacements.\n\n7. **Arbitration conclusion target: within 180 days**  \n   - “The Parties agree … to take any action necessary to conclude an arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator.” [9]  \n   - This is a 180‑day target window to complete arbitration.\n\n8. **Arbitration demand timing: not more than 60 days after service of a pleading**  \n   - “Upon the demand of a party … made before the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross‑claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above…” [9], [18]  \n   - This is a 60‑day window to demand arbitration after service of certain court filings.\n\nFrom the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:\n\n9. **Sixty (60) days written notice – termination of agreement**  \n   - “However, either party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement.” [2], [3], [16]  \n   - This is a 60‑day notice period before termination becomes effective.\n\n10. **Reservations of less than 180 days – short‑term/vacation rentals**  \n    - “Short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).” [6], [16]  \n    - This defines a category of rental by a maximum duration of 179 days.\n\n11. **Leases of more than 180 days – long‑term leases**  \n    - “Long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).” [6], [16]  \n    - This defines a category of rental by a minimum duration of 181 days.\n\n12. **Five (5) business days – notice of listing agreement**  \n    - Owner must “Provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.” [16]  \n    - This is a 5‑business‑day notification window.\n\nFrom the **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**:\n\n13. **Ten (10) business days – filing changes to service contract**  \n    - “The owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the County named above within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract.” [4], [17]  \n    - This is a 10‑business‑day filing window.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How are these day‑based time windows described or labeled?\n\nFor each window, the documents use specific labels or contextual descriptions:\n\n- **“For a period of sixty (60) days”** – explicitly labeled as a warranty period for certain items (doors, windows, switches, etc.). [1], [8], [18]\n- **“For a period of one (1) year”** – labeled as a warranty period for structural components and major systems. [11], [18]\n- **“Terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement”** – labeled as the termination of the Limited Warranty term. [5], [8], [10], [18]\n- **“Within one (1) year or sixty (60) [days] as applicable”** – labeled as the deadline for written claims; explicitly tied to coverage. [5], [10], [4], [18]\n- **“Prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period”** – labeled as the time by which the Buyer/Owner must send written notice of defects. [6], [18]\n- **“Within sixty (60) days”** – labeled as the time for the Builder to “repair or replace” covered defects, with possible extension for specified delays. [7], [18]\n- **“Within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute”** – labeled as the target to “conclude an arbitration.” [9]\n- **“Not more than 60 days after service of a complaint …”** – labeled as the time limit for making a demand for binding arbitration after certain pleadings. [9], [18]\n- **“Upon sixty (60) days written notice”** – labeled as the notice period required to terminate the property management agreement. [2], [3], [16]\n- **“Reservations of less than 180 days”** – labeled as “short term and/or vacation rentals.” [6], [16]\n- **“Leases of more than 180 days”** – labeled as “long term leases.” [6], [16]\n- **“Within five (5) business days”** – labeled as the time for the Owner to notify the Agent of a listing agreement. [16]\n- **“Within ten (10) business days”** – labeled as the time for the owner to file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and County. [4], [17]\n\nThese labels clarify whether the window is a **warranty duration**, **notice period**, **performance period**, **procedural deadline**, or **categorization threshold**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What entities, events, or conditions are associated with each day‑based window?\n\n**Builders Limited Warranty**\n\n1. **60‑day warranty period (non‑structural items)**  \n   - **Entities:** Builder, Buyer/Owner. [1], [8], [18]  \n   - **Items covered:** doors (and hardware), windows, electric switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking around exterior openings, plumbing fixtures, cabinet work. [1], [8], [18]  \n   - **Condition:** Items must be free of defects in materials or workmanship during this 60‑day period.\n\n2. **1‑year warranty period (structural and major systems)**  \n   - **Entities:** Builder, Buyer/Owner. [11], [18]  \n   - **Items covered:** floors, ceilings, walls, internal structural components, plumbing (including septic tank if installed by Builder), heating, electric wiring systems, roof. [11], [18]  \n   - **Condition:** Free of defects in materials or workmanship for one year.\n\n3. **Warranty term termination (1 year or 60 days after commencement)**  \n   - **Entities:** Builder, Buyer/Owner. [5], [8], [10], [18]  \n   - **Event:** End of coverage for the applicable warranty (1‑year or 60‑day) after the start date (commencement). [2], [18]\n\n4. **Claim‑filing deadline (within 1 year or 60 days)**  \n   - **Entities:** Buyer/Owner (claimant), Builder (warrantor). [5], [10], [4], [18]  \n   - **Event:** Written claim must be made within the applicable warranty period; otherwise, the claim is not covered “regardless of discoverability.” [5], [10], [4], [18]\n\n5. **Notification of defects (prior to termination of 1‑year or 60‑day period)**  \n   - **Entities:** Buyer/Owner, Builder. [6], [18]  \n   - **Event:** Buyer/Owner must send a written letter describing the defect by certified mail before the warranty period ends. [6], [18]\n\n6. **Repair completion within 60 days**  \n   - **Entities:** Builder (and its subcontractors), Buyer/Owner. [7], [18]  \n   - **Event:** After receiving a written report of a covered defect, Builder must repair or replace the item within 60 days, subject to extension for weather, labor, or material shortages. [7], [18]\n\n7. **Arbitration conclusion within 180 days**  \n   - **Entities:** Parties to the warranty (Builder and Buyer/Owner), arbitrator(s), Administrator. [9], [18]  \n   - **Event:** Arbitration of a Dispute should be concluded within 180 days of filing. [9]\n\n8. **Arbitration demand not more than 60 days after service of pleadings**  \n   - **Entities:** Any party to the dispute. [9], [18]  \n   - **Event:** Demand for binding arbitration must be made before judicial proceedings or within 60 days after service of specified pleadings (complaint, cross‑claim, etc.). [9], [18]\n\n**Property Management Agreement**\n\n9. **60‑day written notice to terminate agreement**  \n   - **Entities:** Owner, Agent. [2], [3], [16]  \n   - **Event:** Either party may terminate the management agreement by giving 60 days written notice. [2], [3], [16]\n\n10. **Reservations of less than 180 days (short‑term/vacation rentals)**  \n    - **Entities:** Owner, Agent, renters/guests. [6], [16]  \n    - **Event/Condition:** Reservations under 180 days are classified as short‑term/vacation rentals and are subject to a 25% management fee. [6], [16]\n\n11. **Leases of more than 180 days (long‑term leases)**  \n    - **Entities:** Owner, Agent, tenants. [6], [16]  \n    - **Event/Condition:** Leases over 180 days are classified as long‑term leases and are subject to a 10% management fee. [6], [16]\n\n12. **5 business days to notify Agent of listing agreement**  \n    - **Entities:** Owner, Agent. [16]  \n    - **Event:** Owner must provide written notification within 5 business days if the property is listed for sale. [16]\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n\n13. **10 business days to file changes to service contract**  \n    - **Entities:** Owner, municipality, County. [4], [17]  \n    - **Event:** Owner must file a copy of any changes or a new service contract within 10 business days from the date of change. [4], [17]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Relationships or dependencies between the day‑based time windows\n\n**Within the Builders Limited Warranty**\n\n- **Coverage vs. claim deadlines:**  \n  - The **60‑day** and **1‑year** warranty periods define when defects are covered. [1], [8], [11], [18]  \n  - The **claim‑filing deadline** (“within one (1) year or sixty (60) [days] as applicable”) is explicitly tied to those same periods; claims must be made before the applicable warranty period ends. [5], [10], [4], [6], [18]  \n  - Thus, the **coverage window and the claim window are coextensive**: if the period ends, both coverage and the right to claim end.\n\n- **Notification vs. repair performance:**  \n  - Buyer/Owner must notify the Builder **before the end of the 60‑day or 1‑year period**. [6], [18]  \n  - Once notified, the Builder has **60 days** to repair or replace the defect. [7], [18]  \n  - Therefore, the **repair window (60 days)** can extend beyond the warranty period itself, as long as the defect was reported within the warranty period.\n\n- **Arbitration timing vs. claims:**  \n  - A party may demand arbitration **before judicial proceedings or within 60 days after service of certain pleadings**. [9], [18]  \n  - Once a Dispute is filed with the Administrator, the parties agree to conclude arbitration **within 180 days**. [9]  \n  - These arbitration windows are **procedural** and can apply to disputes about warranty claims, but they are distinct from the warranty coverage and claim‑filing windows.\n\n**Within the Property Management Agreement**\n\n- **Termination notice vs. ongoing obligations:**  \n  - The agreement can be terminated by either party with **60 days written notice**. [2], [3], [16]  \n  - Termination “does not invalidate any existing rental agreements” and Owner must honor all confirmed reservations. [3], [16]  \n  - Thus, the 60‑day notice period governs the management relationship, but **does not cut off obligations under existing reservations**, which themselves may be short‑term (<180 days) or long‑term (>180 days). [3], [6], [16]\n\n- **180‑day thresholds as classification boundaries:**  \n  - **Less than 180 days** → short‑term/vacation rentals (25% fee). [6], [16]  \n  - **More than 180 days** → long‑term leases (10% fee). [6], [16]  \n  - These are not deadlines but **categorization thresholds** that determine fee structure and how the rental is treated.\n\n- **5‑business‑day notice vs. management duties:**  \n  - Owner must notify Agent within **5 business days** of a listing agreement. [16]  \n  - This ensures the Agent is aware of potential sale activity while still managing rentals; it interacts with the Agent’s duties to control access and manage reservations, but does not directly alter the 60‑day termination notice or the 180‑day rental classifications. [16]\n\n**Within the Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n\n- **10‑business‑day filing window vs. contract changes:**  \n  - The contract remains in effect until terminated, but any change or new service contract must be filed within **10 business days** of the change. [4], [17]  \n  - This window is a **regulatory compliance deadline** and does not interact with other day‑based windows in the other documents.\n\n**Across documents**\n\n- Multiple **60‑day windows** appear, but with different functions:\n  - 60‑day warranty coverage for certain home components. [1], [8], [18]\n  - 60‑day claim‑filing limit (where applicable). [5], [10], [4], [6], [18]\n  - 60‑day repair completion window. [7], [18]\n  - 60‑day window to demand arbitration after service of pleadings. [9], [18]\n  - 60‑day written notice to terminate the property management agreement. [2], [3], [16]  \n  These are **independent**; each applies in its own contractual context.\n\n- **180‑day windows**:\n  - 180‑day arbitration conclusion target. [9]\n  - 180‑day threshold distinguishing short‑term vs. long‑term rentals. [6], [16]  \n  Again, these are unrelated in function: one is a procedural deadline, the other a classification boundary.\n\n- **Business‑day windows** (5 and 10 business days) are used for **notice and filing obligations** in different contracts and do not cross‑interact. [16]; [4], [17]\n\n---\n\n### 5. Clarifying interpretation and implications when focusing only on day‑based windows\n\nFocusing strictly on day‑based windows clarifies several interpretive points:\n\n1. **Coverage vs. enforcement in the Builders Warranty**  \n   - The **1‑year** and **60‑day** periods define both coverage and the deadline for written claims. [1], [5], [8], [10], [11], [18]  \n   - The phrase “REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY” means that even if a defect is discovered later, it is not covered if not claimed within the applicable period. [5], [10], [4], [18]  \n   - However, once a timely claim is made, the Builder’s obligation to repair within **60 days** can extend beyond the warranty period itself. [7], [18]  \n   - Interpretation: **timely notice locks in the right to repair**, even if the actual repair occurs after the warranty period ends.\n\n2. **Procedural vs. substantive time limits**  \n   - Substantive limits: 60‑day and 1‑year warranty periods, and the matching claim deadlines, define **whether a claim is covered at all**. [1], [5], [8], [10], [11], [18]  \n   - Procedural limits: 60‑day arbitration demand window and 180‑day arbitration conclusion target govern **how disputes are resolved**, not whether the underlying claim is timely under the warranty. [9], [18]\n\n3. **Notice and classification in the Property Management Agreement**  \n   - The **60‑day termination notice** is a forward‑looking requirement; it does not retroactively affect existing reservations, which must still be honored. [2], [3], [16]  \n   - The **<180 days / >180 days** thresholds are purely classificatory, affecting fee percentages but not functioning as deadlines. [6], [16]  \n   - The **5‑business‑day** notice of a listing agreement is a coordination mechanism between sale activity and rental management, not a termination or coverage limit. [16]\n\n4. **Regulatory compliance in the Holding Tank Contract**  \n   - The **10‑business‑day** filing requirement is a compliance deadline with the municipality and County; failure to meet it could have regulatory consequences, but it does not define service frequency or duration of the contract (which continues until terminated). [4], [17]\n\n5. **No implied day‑based windows beyond those stated**  \n   - Where the documents use months or years (e.g., “twelve months” initial term of the management agreement [2], [3], [16]), those are not converted into days for this analysis; only explicitly day‑based expressions (including “business days” and “180 days”) are considered, as required.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Original query focus:** “Compare ‘time windows’ across the set: list all explicit day‑based timeframes.”  \n  The sub‑questions collectively:\n  - Identified all explicit day‑based windows (warranty durations, notice periods, performance periods, arbitration and regulatory deadlines, and classification thresholds). [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [16], [17], [18]\n  - Clarified how each is labeled (warranty period, termination, claim deadline, notice, classification, etc.). [1], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [16], [18]\n  - Mapped each window to the specific entities, events, and conditions it governs (e.g., Builder vs. Buyer/Owner; Owner vs. Agent; Owner vs. County). [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11], [16], [17], [18]\n  - Analyzed relationships and dependencies (e.g., claim deadlines tied to coverage periods; repair windows following timely notice; termination notice coexisting with ongoing reservations). [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [16], [18]\n  - Interpreted the implications: which windows are substantive vs. procedural, how late discovery is treated, and how classification thresholds differ from deadlines. [1], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [16], [18]\n\nTogether, these steps provide a comprehensive comparison of all explicit day‑based time windows across the three contracts and clarify their roles and interactions.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the provided documents, the explicit day‑based time windows are:\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty:**  \n  - 60‑day warranty for specified non‑structural items. [1], [8], [18]  \n  - 1‑year warranty for structural and major systems (not day‑expressed but paired with day‑based claim language). [11], [18]  \n  - Termination of warranty: 1 year or 60 days after commencement, as applicable. [5], [8], [10], [18]  \n  - Claim‑filing deadline: within 1 year or 60 days, as applicable, regardless of discoverability. [5], [10], [4], [6], [18]  \n  - Notification of defects: prior to termination of the 1‑year or 60‑day period. [6], [18]  \n  - Repair completion: within 60 days after receipt of a covered defect report. [7], [18]  \n  - Arbitration demand: not more than 60 days after service of specified pleadings. [9], [18]  \n  - Arbitration conclusion: within 180 days of filing a Dispute. [9]\n\n- **Property Management Agreement:**  \n  - 60‑day written notice to terminate the agreement. [2], [3], [16]  \n  - Reservations of less than 180 days classified as short‑term/vacation rentals. [6], [16]  \n  - Leases of more than 180 days classified as long‑term leases. [6], [16]  \n  - 5 business days for Owner to notify Agent of a listing agreement. [16]\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract:**  \n  - 10 business days for Owner to file changes or a new service contract with the municipality and County. [4], [17]\n\nThese windows serve different functions—defining coverage periods, claim and notice deadlines, performance obligations, dispute‑resolution timelines, regulatory filing requirements, and rental classifications—and are largely independent across documents, with internal dependencies primarily within each contract’s own framework.",

the parties agree  to take any action necessary to conclude an arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a dispute with the administrator. 9 - this is a 180day target window to complete arbitration. 8. arbitration demand timing: not more than 60 days after service of a pleading - upon the demand of a party  made before the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint third party complaint crossclaim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above 9 18 - this is a 60day window to demand arbitration after service of certain court filings. from the property management agreement: 9. sixty 60 days written notice  termination of agreement - however either party upon sixty 60 days written notice may terminate this agreement. 2 3 16 - this is a 60day notice period before termination becomes effective. 10. reservations of less than 180 days  shortterm/vacation rentals - short term and/or vacation rentals reservations of less than 180 days. 6 16 - this defines a category of rental by a maximum duration of 179 days. 11. leases of more than 180 days  longterm leases - long term leases leases of more than 180 days. 6 16 - this defines a category of rental by a minimum duration of 181 days. 12. five 5 business days  notice of listing agreement - owner must provide agent with written notification within five 5 business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale. 16 - this is a 5businessday notification window. from the holding tank servicing contract: 13. ten 10 business days  filing changes to service contract - the owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the county named above within ten 10 business days from the date of change to this service contract. 4 17 - this is a 10businessday filing window. ---  2. how are these daybased time windows described or labeled for each window the documents use specific labels or contextual descriptions: - for a period of sixty 60 days  explicitly labeled as a warranty period for certain items doors windows switches etc.. 1 8 18 - for a period of one 1 year  labeled as a warranty period for structural components and major systems. 11 18 - terminate one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable after commencement  labeled as the termination of the limited warranty term. 5 8 10 18 - within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable  labeled as the deadline for written claims explicitly tied to coverage. 5 10 4 18 - prior to the termination of the one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period  labeled as the time by which the buyer/owner must send written notice of defects. 6 18 - within sixty 60 days  labeled as the time for the builder to repair or replace covered defects with possible extension for specified delays. 7 18 - within 180 days of the filing of a dispute  labeled as the target to conclude an arbitration. 9 - not more than 60 days after service of a complaint   labeled as the time limit for making a demand for binding arbitration after certain pleadings. 9 18 - upon sixty 60 days written notice  labeled as the notice period required to terminate the property management agreement. 2 3 16 - reservations of less than 180 days  labeled as short term and/or vacation rentals. 6 16 - leases of more than 180 days  labeled as long term leases. 6 16 - within five 5 business days  labeled as the time for the owner to notify the agent of a listing agreement. 16 - within ten 10 business days  labeled as the time for the owner to file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and county. 4 17 these labels clarify whether the window is a warranty duration notice period performance period procedural deadline or categorization threshold. ---  3. what entities events or conditions are associated with each daybased window builders limited warranty 1. 60day warranty period nonstructural items - entities: builder buyer/owner. 1 8 18 - items covered: doors and hardware windows electric switches receptacles fixtures caulking around exterior openings plumbing fixtures cabinet work. 1 8 18 - condition: items must be free of defects in materials or workmanship during this 60day period. 2. 1year warranty period structural and major systems - entities: builder buyer/owner. 11 18 - items covered: floors ceilings walls internal structural components plumbing including septic tank if installed by builder heating electric wiring systems roof. 11 18 - condition: free of defects in materials or workmanship for one year. 3. warranty term termination 1 year or 60 days after commencement - entities: builder buyer/owner. 5 8 10 18 - event: end of coverage for the applicable warranty 1year or 60day after the start date commencement. 2 18 4. claimfiling deadline within 1 year or 60 days - entities: buyer/owner claimant builder warrantor. 5 10 4 18 - event: written claim must be made within the applicable warranty period otherwise the claim is not covered regardless of discoverability. 5 10 4 18 5. notification of defects prior to termination of 1year or 60day period - entities: buyer/owner builder. 6 18 - event: buyer/owner must send a written letter describing the defect by certified mail before the warranty period ends. 6 18 6. repair completion within 60 days - entities: builder and its subcontractors buyer/owner. 7 18 - event: after receiving a written report of a covered defect builder must repair or replace the item within 60 days subject to extension for weather labor or material shortages. 7 18 7. arbitration conclusion within 180 days - entities: parties to the warranty builder and buyer/owner arbitrators administrator. 9 18 - event: arbitration of a dispute should be concluded within 180 days of filing. 9 8. arbitration demand not more than 60 days after service of pleadings - entities: any party to the dispute. 9 18 - event: demand for binding arbitration must be made before judicial proceedings or within 60 days after service of specified pleadings complaint crossclaim etc.. 9 18 property management agreement 9. 60day written notice to terminate agreement - entities: owner agent. 2 3 16 - event: either party may terminate the management agreement by giving 60 days written notice. 2 3 16 10. reservations of less than 180 days shortterm/vacation rentals - entities: owner agent renters/guests. 6 16 - event/condition: reservations under 180 days are classified as shortterm/vacation rentals and are subject to a 25% management fee. 6 16 11. leases of more than 180 days longterm leases - entities: owner agent tenants. 6 16 - event/condition: leases over 180 days are classified as longterm leases and are subject to a 10% management fee. 6 16 12. 5 business days to notify agent of listing agreement - entities: owner agent. 16 - event: owner must provide written notification within 5 business days if the property is listed for sale. 16 holding tank servicing contract 13. 10 business days to file changes to service contract - entities: owner municipality county. 4 17 - event: owner must file a copy of any changes or a new service contract within 10 business days from the date of change. 4 17 ---  4. relationships or dependencies between the daybased time windows within the builders limited warranty - coverage vs. claim deadlines: - the 60day and 1year warranty periods define when defects are covered. 1 8 11 18 - the claimfiling deadline within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable is explicitly tied to those same periods claims must be made before the applicable warranty period ends. 5 10 4 6 18 - thus the coverage window and the claim window are coextensive: if the period ends both coverage and the right to claim end. - notification vs. repair performance: - buyer/owner must notify the builder before the end of the 60day or 1year period. 6 18 - once notified the builder has 60 days to repair or replace the defect. 7 18 - therefore the repair window 60 days can extend beyond the warranty period itself as long as the defect was reported within the warranty period. - arbitration timing vs. claims: - a party may demand arbitration before judicial proceedings or within 60 days after service of certain pleadings. 9 18 - once a dispute is filed with the administrator the parties agree to conclude arbitration within 180 days. 9 - these arbitration windows are procedural and can apply to disputes about warranty claims but they are distinct from the warranty coverage and claimfiling windows. within the property management agreement - termination notice vs. ongoing obligations: - the agreement can be terminated by either party with 60 days written notice. 2 3 16 - termination does not invalidate any existing rental agreements and owner must honor all confirmed reservations. 3 16 - thus the 60day notice period governs the management relationship but does not cut off obligations under existing reservations which themselves may be shortterm 180 days or longterm 180 days. 3 6 16 - 180day thresholds as classification boundaries: - less than 180 days  shortterm/vacation rentals 25% fee. 6 16 - more than 180 days  longterm leases 10% fee. 6 16 - these are not deadlines but categorization thresholds that determine fee structure and how the rental is treated. - 5businessday notice vs. management duties: - owner must notify agent within 5 business days of a listing agreement. 16 - this ensures the agent is aware of potential sale activity while still managing rentals it interacts with the agents duties to control access and manage reservations but does not directly alter the 60day termination notice or the 180day rental classifications. 16 within the holding tank servicing contract - 10businessday filing window vs. contract changes: - the contract remains in effect until terminated but any change or new service contract must be filed within 10 business days of the change. 4 17 - this window is a regulatory compliance deadline and does not interact with other daybased windows in the other documents. across documents - multiple 60day windows appear but with different functions: - 60day warranty coverage for certain home components. 1 8 18 - 60day claimfiling limit where applicable. 5 10 4 6 18 - 60day repair completion window. 7 18 - 60day window to demand arbitration after service of pleadings. 9 18 - 60day written notice to terminate the property management agreement. 2 3 16 these are independent each applies in its own contractual context. - 180day windows: - 180day arbitration conclusion target. 9 - 180day threshold distinguishing shortterm vs. longterm rentals. 6 16 again these are unrelated in function: one is a procedural deadline the other a classification boundary. - businessday windows 5 and 10 business days are used for notice and filing obligations in different contracts and do not crossinteract. 16 4 17 ---  5. clarifying interpretation and implications when focusing only on daybased windows focusing strictly on daybased windows clarifies several interpretive points: 1. coverage vs. enforcement in the builders warranty - the 1year and 60day periods define both coverage and the deadline for written claims. 1 5 8 10 11 18 - the phrase regardless of discoverability means that even if a defect is discovered later it is not covered if not claimed within the applicable period. 5 10 4 18 - however once a timely claim is made the builders obligation to repair within 60 days can extend beyond the warranty period itself. 7 18 - interpretation: timely notice locks in the right to repair even if the actual repair occurs after the warranty period ends. 2. procedural vs. substantive time limits - substantive limits: 60day and 1year warranty periods and the matching claim deadlines define whether a claim is covered at all. 1 5 8 10 11 18 - procedural limits: 60day arbitration demand window and 180day arbitration conclusion target govern how disputes are resolved not whether the underlying claim is timely under the warranty. 9 18 3. notice and classification in the property management agreement - the 60day termination notice is a forwardlooking requirement it does not retroactively affect existing reservations which must still be honored. 2 3 16 - the 180 days / 180 days thresholds are purely classificatory affecting fee percentages but not functioning as deadlines. 6 16 - the 5businessday notice of a listing agreement is a coordination mechanism between sale activity and rental management not a termination or coverage limit. 16 4. regulatory compliance in the holding tank contract - the 10businessday filing requirement is a compliance deadline with the municipality and county failure to meet it could have regulatory consequences but it does not define service frequency or duration of the contract which continues until terminated. 4 17 5. no implied daybased windows beyond those stated - where the documents use months or years e.g. twelve months initial term of the management agreement 2 3 16 those are not converted into days for this analysis only explicitly daybased expressions including business days and 180 days are considered as required. ---  key connections - original query focus: compare time windows across the set: list all explicit daybased timeframes. the subquestions collectively: - identified all explicit daybased windows warranty durations notice periods performance periods arbitration and regulatory deadlines and classification thresholds. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 16 17 18 - clarified how each is labeled warranty period termination claim deadline notice classification etc.. 1 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 16 18 - mapped each window to the specific entities events and conditions it governs e.g. builder vs. buyer/owner owner vs. agent owner vs. county. 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 11 16 17 18 - analyzed relationships and dependencies e.g. claim deadlines tied to coverage periods repair windows following timely notice termination notice coexisting with ongoing reservations. 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 16 18 - interpreted the implications: which windows are substantive vs. procedural how late discovery is treated and how classification thresholds differ from deadlines. 1 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 16 18 together these steps provide a comprehensive comparison of all explicit daybased time windows across the three contracts and clarify their roles and interactions. ---  conclusion across the provided documents the explicit daybased time windows are: - builders limited warranty: - 60day warranty for specified nonstructural items. 1 8 18 - 1year warranty for structural and major systems not dayexpressed but paired with daybased claim language. 11 18 - termination of warranty: 1 year or 60 days after commencement as applicable. 5 8 10 18 - claimfiling deadline: within 1 year or 60 days as applicable regardless of discoverability. 5 10 4 6 18 - notification of defects: prior to termination of the 1year or 60day period. 6 18 - repair completion: within 60 days after receipt of a covered defect report. 7 18 - arbitration demand: not more than 60 days after service of specified pleadings. 9 18 - arbitration conclusion: within 180 days of filing a dispute. 9 - property management agreement: - 60day written notice to terminate the agreement. 2 3 16 - reservations of less than 180 days classified as shortterm/vacation rentals. 6 16 - leases of more than 180 days classified as longterm leases. 6 16 - 5 business days for owner to notify agent of a listing agreement. 16 - holding tank servicing contract: - 10 business days for owner to file changes or a new service contract with the municipality and county. 4 17 these windows serve different functionsdefining coverage periods claim and notice deadlines performance obligations disputeresolution timelines regulatory filing requirements and rental classificationsand are largely independent across documents with internal dependencies primarily within each contracts own framework.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\nBelow, I walk through the sub‑questions in order, using only **explicitly stated day‑based time windows** (i.e., periods expressed in days, such as “60 days,” “10 business days,” “less than 180 days,” etc.), and then synthesize them.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Identify all explicitly stated day‑based time windows\n\nFrom the **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**:\n\n1. **Sixty (60) days – defect‑free coverage for certain items**  \n   - “The Builder warrants that … for a period of sixty (60) days that the following items will be free of defects in materials or workmanship: doors … windows, electric switches, receptacles, and fixtures; caulking around exterior openings, plumbing fixtures and cabinet work.” [1], [8], [18]  \n   - This is a 60‑day warranty window for specified non‑structural items.\n\n2. **One (1) year – defect‑free coverage for structural and major systems**  \n   - “The Builder warrants for a period of one (1) year that … floors, ceilings, walls, and other internal structural components … the plumbing … heating, and electric wiring systems; and the roof will be free of defects in materials or workmanship.” [11], [18]  \n   - This is a 1‑year warranty window for structural and major systems.\n\n3. **Termination of warranty: one (1) year or sixty (60) days after commencement**  \n   - “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement.” [5], [8], [10], [18]  \n   - This defines the overall duration of each coverage type (1‑year or 60‑day) from the start date.\n\n4. **Claim‑filing deadline: within one (1) year or sixty (60) days**  \n   - “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [5], [10], [18]  \n   - “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.” [4], [18]  \n   - This is a hard deadline for written claims, matching the applicable warranty period.\n\n5. **Notification deadline for defects: prior to termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day period**  \n   - “If Buyer/Owner believes a defect is covered … the Buyer/Owner must, prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable, write a letter describing the defect…” [6], [18]  \n   - This restates the claim‑filing window in operational terms.\n\n6. **Repair completion window: within sixty (60) days**  \n   - “The Builder will repair or replace it at no charge … within sixty (60) days (longer if weather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages cause delays).” [7], [18]  \n   - This is a 60‑day performance window for the Builder to complete repairs/replacements.\n\n7. **Arbitration conclusion target: within 180 days**  \n   - “The Parties agree … to take any action necessary to conclude an arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator.” [9]  \n   - This is a 180‑day target window to complete arbitration.\n\n8. **Arbitration demand timing: not more than 60 days after service of a pleading**  \n   - “Upon the demand of a party … made before the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross‑claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above…” [9], [18]  \n   - This is a 60‑day window to demand arbitration after service of certain court filings.\n\nFrom the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:\n\n9. **Sixty (60) days written notice – termination of agreement**  \n   - “However, either party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement.” [2], [3], [16]  \n   - This is a 60‑day notice period before termination becomes effective.\n\n10. **Reservations of less than 180 days – short‑term/vacation rentals**  \n    - “Short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).” [6], [16]  \n    - This defines a category of rental by a maximum duration of 179 days.\n\n11. **Leases of more than 180 days – long‑term leases**  \n    - “Long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).” [6], [16]  \n    - This defines a category of rental by a minimum duration of 181 days.\n\n12. **Five (5) business days – notice of listing agreement**  \n    - Owner must “Provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.” [16]  \n    - This is a 5‑business‑day notification window.\n\nFrom the **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**:\n\n13. **Ten (10) business days – filing changes to service contract**  \n    - “The owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the County named above within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract.” [4], [17]  \n    - This is a 10‑business‑day filing window.\n\n---\n\n### 2. How are these day‑based time windows described or labeled?\n\nFor each window, the documents use specific labels or contextual descriptions:\n\n- **“For a period of sixty (60) days”** – explicitly labeled as a warranty period for certain items (doors, windows, switches, etc.). [1], [8], [18]\n- **“For a period of one (1) year”** – labeled as a warranty period for structural components and major systems. [11], [18]\n- **“Terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement”** – labeled as the termination of the Limited Warranty term. [5], [8], [10], [18]\n- **“Within one (1) year or sixty (60) [days] as applicable”** – labeled as the deadline for written claims; explicitly tied to coverage. [5], [10], [4], [18]\n- **“Prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period”** – labeled as the time by which the Buyer/Owner must send written notice of defects. [6], [18]\n- **“Within sixty (60) days”** – labeled as the time for the Builder to “repair or replace” covered defects, with possible extension for specified delays. [7], [18]\n- **“Within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute”** – labeled as the target to “conclude an arbitration.” [9]\n- **“Not more than 60 days after service of a complaint …”** – labeled as the time limit for making a demand for binding arbitration after certain pleadings. [9], [18]\n- **“Upon sixty (60) days written notice”** – labeled as the notice period required to terminate the property management agreement. [2], [3], [16]\n- **“Reservations of less than 180 days”** – labeled as “short term and/or vacation rentals.” [6], [16]\n- **“Leases of more than 180 days”** – labeled as “long term leases.” [6], [16]\n- **“Within five (5) business days”** – labeled as the time for the Owner to notify the Agent of a listing agreement. [16]\n- **“Within ten (10) business days”** – labeled as the time for the owner to file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and County. [4], [17]\n\nThese labels clarify whether the window is a **warranty duration**, **notice period**, **performance period**, **procedural deadline**, or **categorization threshold**.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What entities, events, or conditions are associated with each day‑based window?\n\n**Builders Limited Warranty**\n\n1. **60‑day warranty period (non‑structural items)**  \n   - **Entities:** Builder, Buyer/Owner. [1], [8], [18]  \n   - **Items covered:** doors (and hardware), windows, electric switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking around exterior openings, plumbing fixtures, cabinet work.

[5], [10], [4], [18]  \n   - **Event:** Written claim must be made within the applicable warranty period; otherwise, the claim is not covered “regardless of discoverability.” [5], [10], [4], [18]\n\n5. **Notification of defects (prior to termination of 1‑year or 60‑day period)**  \n   - **Entities:** Buyer/Owner, Builder. [6], [18]  \n   - **Event:** Buyer/Owner must send a written letter describing the defect by certified mail before the warranty period ends. [6], [18]\n\n6. **Repair completion within 60 days**  \n   - **Entities:** Builder (and its subcontractors), Buyer/Owner. [7], [18]  \n   - **Event:** After receiving a written report of a covered defect, Builder must repair or replace the item within 60 days, subject to extension for weather, labor, or material shortages. [7], [18]\n\n7. **Arbitration conclusion within 180 days**  \n   - **Entities:** Parties to the warranty (Builder and Buyer/Owner), arbitrator(s), Administrator. [9], [18]  \n   - **Event:** Arbitration of a Dispute should be concluded within 180 days of filing. [9]\n\n8. **Arbitration demand not more than 60 days after service of pleadings**  \n   - **Entities:** Any party to the dispute. [9], [18]  \n   - **Event:** Demand for binding arbitration must be made before judicial proceedings or within 60 days after service of specified pleadings (complaint, cross‑claim, etc.). [9], [18]\n\n**Property Management Agreement**\n\n9. **60‑day written notice to terminate agreement**  \n   - **Entities:** Owner, Agent. [2], [3], [16]  \n   - **Event:** Either party may terminate the management agreement by giving 60 days written notice. [2], [3], [16]\n\n10. **Reservations of less than 180 days (short‑term/vacation rentals)**  \n    - **Entities:** Owner, Agent, renters/guests. [6], [16]  \n    - **Event/Condition:** Reservations under 180 days are classified as short‑term/vacation rentals and are subject to a 25% management fee. [6], [16]\n\n11. **Leases of more than 180 days (long‑term leases)**  \n    - **Entities:** Owner, Agent, tenants. [6], [16]  \n    - **Event/Condition:** Leases over 180 days are classified as long‑term leases and are subject to a 10% management fee. [6], [16]\n\n12. **5 business days to notify Agent of listing agreement**  \n    - **Entities:** Owner, Agent.

[4], [17]  \n    - **Event:** Owner must file a copy of any changes or a new service contract within 10 business days from the date of change. [4], [17]\n\n---\n\n### 4. Relationships or dependencies between the day‑based time windows\n\n**Within the Builders Limited Warranty**\n\n- **Coverage vs. claim deadlines:**  \n  - The **60‑day** and **1‑year** warranty periods define when defects are covered. [1], [8], [11], [18]  \n  - The **claim‑filing deadline** (“within one (1) year or sixty (60) [days] as applicable”) is explicitly tied to those same periods; claims must be made before the applicable warranty period ends. [5], [10], [4], [6], [18]  \n  - Thus, the **coverage window and the claim window are coextensive**: if the period ends, both coverage and the right to claim end.\n\n- **Notification vs. repair performance:**  \n  - Buyer/Owner must notify the Builder **before the end of the 60‑day or 1‑year period**. [6], [18]  \n  - Once notified, the Builder has **60 days** to repair or replace the defect. [7], [18]  \n  - Therefore, the **repair window (60 days)** can extend beyond the warranty period itself, as long as the defect was reported within the warranty period.\n\n- **Arbitration timing vs. claims:**  \n  - A party may demand arbitration **before judicial proceedings or within 60 days after service of certain pleadings**. [9], [18]  \n  - Once a Dispute is filed with the Administrator, the parties agree to conclude arbitration **within 180 days**. [9]  \n  - These arbitration windows are **procedural** and can apply to disputes about warranty claims, but they are distinct from the warranty coverage and claim‑filing windows.\n\n**Within the Property Management Agreement**\n\n- **Termination notice vs. ongoing obligations:**  \n  - The agreement can be terminated by either party with **60 days written notice**. [2], [3], [16]  \n  - Termination “does not invalidate any existing rental agreements” and Owner must honor all confirmed reservations. [3], [16]  \n  - Thus, the 60‑day notice period governs the management relationship, but **does not cut off obligations under existing reservations**, which themselves may be short‑term (<180 days) or long‑term (>180 days). [3], [6], [16]\n\n- **180‑day thresholds as classification boundaries:**  \n  - **Less than 180 days** → short‑term/vacation rentals (25% fee). [6], [16]  \n  - **More than 180 days** → long‑term leases (10% fee). [6], [16]  \n  - These are not deadlines but **categorization thresholds** that determine fee structure and how the rental is treated.\n\n- **5‑business‑day notice vs. management duties:**  \n  - Owner must notify Agent within **5 business days** of a listing agreement. [16]  \n  - This ensures the Agent is aware of potential sale activity while still managing rentals; it interacts with the Agent’s duties to control access and manage reservations, but does not directly alter the 60‑day termination notice or the 180‑day rental classifications. [16]\n\n**Within the Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n\n- **10‑business‑day filing window vs. contract changes:**  \n  - The contract remains in effect until terminated, but any change or new service contract must be filed within **10 business days** of the change. [4], [17]  \n  - This window is a **regulatory compliance deadline** and does not interact with other day‑based windows in the other documents.\n\n**Across documents**\n\n- Multiple **60‑day windows** appear, but with different functions:\n  - 60‑day warranty coverage for certain home components. [1], [8], [18]\n  - 60‑day claim‑filing limit (where applicable). [5], [10], [4], [6], [18]\n  - 60‑day repair completion window. [7], [18]\n  - 60‑day window to demand arbitration after service of pleadings. [9], [18]\n  - 60‑day written notice to terminate the property management agreement. [2], [3], [16]  \n  These are **independent**; each applies in its own contractual context.\n\n- **180‑day windows**:\n  - 180‑day arbitration conclusion target. [9]\n  - 180‑day threshold distinguishing short‑term vs. long‑term rentals. [6], [16]  \n  Again, these are unrelated in function: one is a procedural deadline, the other a classification boundary.\n\n- **Business‑day windows** (5 and 10 business days) are used for **notice and filing obligations** in different contracts and do not cross‑interact. [16]; [4], [17]\n\n---\n\n### 5. Clarifying interpretation and implications when focusing only on day‑based windows\n\nFocusing strictly on day‑based windows clarifies several interpretive points:\n\n1. **Coverage vs. enforcement in the Builders Warranty**  \n   - The **1‑year** and **60‑day** periods define both coverage and the deadline for written claims. [1], [5], [8], [10], [11], [18]  \n   - The phrase “REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY” means that even if a defect is discovered later, it is not covered if not claimed within the applicable period. [5], [10], [4], [18]  \n   - However, once a timely claim is made, the Builder’s obligation to repair within **60 days** can extend beyond the warranty period itself. [7], [18]  \n   - Interpretation: **timely notice locks in the right to repair**, even if the actual repair occurs after the warranty period ends.\n\n2. **Procedural vs. substantive time limits**  \n   - Substantive limits: 60‑day and 1‑year warranty periods, and the matching claim deadlines, define **whether a claim is covered at all**. [1], [5], [8], [10], [11], [18]  \n   - Procedural limits: 60‑day arbitration demand window and 180‑day arbitration conclusion target govern **how disputes are resolved**, not whether the underlying claim is timely under the warranty. [9], [18]\n\n3. **Notice and classification in the Property Management Agreement**  \n   - The **60‑day termination notice** is a forward‑looking requirement; it does not retroactively affect existing reservations, which must still be honored. [2], [3], [16]  \n   - The **<180 days / >180 days** thresholds are purely classificatory, affecting fee percentages but not functioning as deadlines. [6], [16]  \n   - The **5‑business‑day** notice of a listing agreement is a coordination mechanism between sale activity and rental management, not a termination or coverage limit. [16]\n\n4. **Regulatory compliance in the Holding Tank Contract**  \n   - The **10‑business‑day** filing requirement is a compliance deadline with the municipality and County; failure to meet it could have regulatory consequences, but it does not define service frequency or duration of the contract (which continues until terminated). [4], [17]\n\n5. **No implied day‑based windows beyond those stated**  \n   - Where the documents use months or years (e.g., “twelve months” initial term of the management agreement [2], [3], [16]), those are not converted into days for this analysis; only explicitly day‑based expressions (including “business days” and “180 days”) are considered, as required.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Original query focus:** “Compare ‘time windows’ across the set: list all explicit day‑based timeframes.”  \n  The sub‑questions collectively:\n  - Identified all explicit day‑based windows (warranty durations, notice periods, performance periods, arbitration and regulatory deadlines, and classification thresholds). [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [16], [17], [18]\n  - Clarified how each is labeled (warranty period, termination, claim deadline, notice, classification, etc.). [1], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [16], [18]\n  - Mapped each window to the specific entities, events, and conditions it governs (e.g., Builder vs. Buyer/Owner; Owner vs. Agent; Owner vs. County). [1], [2], [3], [4], [6], [7], [8], [9], [11], [16], [17], [18]\n  - Analyzed relationships and dependencies (e.g., claim deadlines tied to coverage periods; repair windows following timely notice; termination notice coexisting with ongoing reservations). [3], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [16], [18]\n  - Interpreted the implications: which windows are substantive vs. procedural, how late discovery is treated, and how classification thresholds differ from deadlines. [1], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [16], [18]\n\nTogether, these steps provide a comprehensive comparison of all explicit day‑based time windows across the three contracts and clarify their roles and interactions.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the provided documents, the explicit day‑based time windows are:\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty:**  \n  - 60‑day warranty for specified non‑structural items. [1], [8], [18]  \n  - 1‑year warranty for structural and major systems (not day‑expressed but paired with day‑based claim language). [11], [18]  \n  - Termination of warranty: 1 year or 60 days after commencement, as applicable. [5], [8], [10], [18]  \n  - Claim‑filing deadline: within 1 year or 60 days, as applicable, regardless of discoverability. [5], [10], [4], [6], [18]  \n  - Notification of defects: prior to termination of the 1‑year or 60‑day period. [6], [18]  \n  - Repair completion: within 60 days after receipt of a covered defect report. [7], [18]  \n  - Arbitration demand: not more than 60 days after service of specified pleadings. [9], [18]  \n  - Arbitration conclusion: within 180 days of filing a Dispute. [9]\n\n- **Property Management Agreement:**  \n  - 60‑day written notice to terminate the agreement. [2], [3], [16]  \n  - Reservations of less than 180 days classified as short‑term/vacation rentals. [6], [16]  \n  - Leases of more than 180 days classified as long‑term leases. [6], [16]  \n  - 5 business days for Owner to notify Agent of a listing agreement. [16]\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract:**  \n  - 10 business days for Owner to file changes or a new service contract with the municipality and County. [4], [17]\n\nThese windows serve different functions—defining coverage periods, claim and notice deadlines, performance obligations, dispute‑resolution timelines, regulatory filing requirements, and rental classifications—and are largely independent across documents, with internal dependencies primarily within each contract’s own framework.",

[4], [18]  \n   - Notification of defects must be made “prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable.” [18]\n\n3. **Sixty (60) days – time for the Builder to complete repairs**  \n   - After receiving a written report of a covered defect, the Builder will “repair or replace it at no charge … within sixty (60) days (longer if weather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages cause delays).” [18]\n\n4. **Not more than 60 days – deadline to demand arbitration after service of a complaint**  \n   - A party may demand arbitration “not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.” [18]\n\n5. **180 days – target to conclude arbitration**  \n   - The parties agree “to take any action necessary to conclude an arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator.” [9]\n\n**From the Property Management Agreement** (doc_30b15aec29f945a8af11fcaedcea6569):\n\n6. **Sixty (60) days written notice – termination of the management agreement**  \n   - Either party may terminate the agreement “upon sixty (60) days written notice.” [2], [3], [16]\n\n7. **Less than 180 days – definition of short-term/vacation rentals**  \n   - Short term and/or vacation rentals are defined as “reservations of less than 180 days.” [6], [16]\n\n8. **More than 180 days – definition of long-term leases**  \n   - Long term leases are defined as “leases of more than 180 days.” [6], [16]\n\n9. **Five (5) business days – owner’s notice of listing agreement**  \n   - The Owner must provide the Agent “written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.” [16]\n\n10. **Monthly charges (implied 30-day cycles)**  \n   - Advertising for short-term rentals is charged at “$75.00/month.” [6], [16]  \n   - Administration and accounting have a “minimum charge … at $50.00/month.” [16]  \n   These are month-based, not day-counts, so they are noted but not central to “day-based” windows.\n\n**From the Holding Tank Servicing Contract** (doc_b9d5cb189767402c85089fb9ae8279fd):\n\n11. **Ten (10) business days – deadline to file changes to the service contract**  \n   - In the event of a change, the owner must file a copy of changes or a new contract “within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract.” [17]\n\n12. **Dates of servicing – day-specific service events**  \n   - The pumper’s report must include “the dates on which the holding tank was serviced.” [7], [14], [17]  \n   These are specific calendar days of service, not fixed-length windows, but they are explicit day references.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Considering only explicit day-based timeframes, what specific entities/items/elements are tied to those timeframes?\n\nFor each timeframe, the associated entities/items/elements are:\n\n**Builders Limited Warranty**:\n\n1. **60-day defect-free coverage** [1], [8], [18]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Doors (including hardware)  \n     - Windows  \n     - Electric switches  \n     - Receptacles  \n     - Fixtures  \n     - Caulking around exterior openings  \n     - Plumbing fixtures  \n     - Cabinet work  \n   - Parties: Builder, Buyer/Owner.\n\n2. **60-day vs. 1-year warranty periods** [4], [5], [10], [18]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - All items covered by the Builder’s Limited Warranty (structural components, systems, and the 60-day items above).  \n   - Parties: Builder, Buyer/Owner.  \n   - Concept: warranty term, claim eligibility.\n\n3. **60 days to complete repairs** [18]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Defective items covered by the warranty.  \n   - Parties: Builder (performing repair/replacement), Buyer/Owner (requesting service).\n\n4. **≤ 60 days to demand arbitration after service of complaint** [18]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - “Any Dispute” arising out of the construction, purchase, warranty, or related documents.  \n   - Parties: Any of the Parties to the warranty agreement; arbitrator(s); Administrator.\n\n5. **180 days to conclude arbitration** [9]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Arbitration proceedings regarding Disputes.  \n   - Parties: The Parties to the warranty; arbitrator(s); Administrator.\n\n**Property Management Agreement**:\n\n6. **60 days written notice to terminate** [2], [3], [16]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - The Property Management Agreement itself (term/termination).  \n   - Parties: Owner (Contoso Ltd.), Agent (Walt Flood Realty).\n\n7. **< 180 days – short-term/vacation rentals** [6], [16]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Short term/vacation rental reservations.  \n     - Management fee/commission of 25% of gross revenues.  \n   - Parties: Owner, Agent, renters/guests.\n\n8. **> 180 days – long-term leases** [6], [16]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Long term leases.  \n     - Management fee/commission of 10% of gross revenues.  \n   - Parties: Owner, Agent, tenants.\n\n9. **5 business days – notice of listing agreement** [16]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Listing agreement for sale of the property.  \n     - Owner’s written notification to Agent.  \n   - Parties: Owner, Agent.\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:\n\n10. **10 business days – filing changes to contract** [17]  \n    - Entities/items:  \n      - Changes to the service contract or a new service contract.  \n      - Filing with the municipality and County.  \n    - Parties: Owner, municipality, County.\n\n11. **Dates of servicing** [7], [14], [17]  \n    - Entities/items:  \n      - Service events for the holding tank (pumping).  \n      - Reports including dates, volumes, disposal sites, condition.  \n    - Parties: Pumper (Fabrikam Inc.), Owner (Contoso Ltd.), County.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What specific relationships between the identified entities/items/elements are defined by these day-based timeframes?\n\n**Builders Limited Warranty**:\n\n1. **60-day item warranty**  \n   - Relationship: For 60 days from commencement, the Builder is obligated to ensure specified finish items (doors, windows, switches, etc.) are free of defects; the Buyer/Owner is the beneficiary. [1], [8], [18]\n\n2. **1-year vs. 60-day warranty windows and claim deadlines**  \n   - Relationship:  \n     - Different categories of items have different maximum coverage periods (either 60 days or 1 year). [5], [10], [18]  \n     - The Buyer/Owner must submit written claims within the applicable period (1 year or 60 days); otherwise, claims are excluded. [4], [18]  \n   - This creates a time-bound relationship between coverage, claim rights, and item category.\n\n3. **60 days to complete repairs**  \n   - Relationship: Once a covered defect is reported in writing, the Builder must repair/replace within 60 days (subject to certain delays). [18]  \n   - This ties the Builder’s performance obligation to a 60-day service window.\n\n4. **≤ 60 days to demand arbitration after complaint**  \n   - Relationship: After service of a complaint or related pleading, any party has up to 60 days to demand arbitration; failure to do so within that window may affect the right to compel arbitration. [18]\n\n5. **180 days to conclude arbitration**  \n   - Relationship: The Parties and arbitrator(s) are expected to act so that arbitration is concluded within 180 days of filing the Dispute, linking procedural conduct to a 180-day target. [9]\n\n**Property Management Agreement**:\n\n6. **60 days written notice to terminate**  \n   - Relationship: Either Owner or Agent may end the management relationship by giving 60 days written notice; the agreement continues in force during that 60-day period. [2], [3], [16]\n\n7. **< 180 days vs. > 180 days – rental classification and fees**  \n   - Relationship:  \n     - Reservations of less than 180 days are “short term and/or vacation rentals” and incur a 25% management fee. [6], [16]  \n     - Leases of more than 180 days are “long term leases” and incur a 10% management fee. [6], [16]  \n   - The length of the rental in days directly determines the fee structure and classification of the tenancy.\n\n8. **5 business days – notice of listing**  \n   - Relationship: If the property is listed for sale, the Owner must notify the Agent within 5 business days, linking the Owner’s sales activity to a prompt disclosure obligation to the Agent. [16]\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:\n\n9. **10 business days – filing changes**  \n   - Relationship: When the service contract changes, the Owner must file the updated contract with the municipality and County within 10 business days, tying regulatory compliance to a 10-day filing window. [17]\n\n10. **Dates of servicing**  \n    - Relationship: Each service event (pumping) is recorded with its specific date, volume, disposal site, and condition, forming a time-stamped compliance and maintenance record between Pumper, Owner, and County. [7], [14], [17]\n\n---\n\n### 4. How do the entities and their relationships change or evolve across these explicit day-based timeframes?\n\n**Within the Builders Limited Warranty**:\n\n- **From commencement to 60 days**:  \n  - The Buyer/Owner has full coverage for both structural systems (1-year items) and the special 60-day items (doors, windows, etc.). [1], [8], [18]  \n  - The Buyer/Owner may discover defects and must be prepared to submit written claims; any 60-day-only items must be claimed within this period. [4], [18]  \n  - If a defect is reported, the Builder has up to 60 days to repair/replace, so a defect reported on day 30 could be addressed up to day 90. [18]\n\n- **From 60 days to 1 year**:  \n  - Coverage for the 60-day items expires; only the 1-year items remain covered. [5], [10], [18]  \n  - The Buyer/Owner can still submit claims for 1-year items until the 1-year mark; after that, claims are barred. [4], [18]\n\n- **Arbitration-related evolution**:  \n  - After a complaint is served, there is a 60-day window to demand arbitration. [18]  \n  - Once a Dispute is filed with the Administrator, the parties aim to conclude arbitration within 180 days, so the dispute resolution process is expected to move from filing to decision within that 180-day arc. [9]\n\n**Within the Property Management Agreement**:\n\n- **Rental duration thresholds (<180 vs. >180 days)**:  \n  - A reservation’s length in days determines whether it is treated as short-term (higher fee, 25%) or long-term (lower fee, 10%). [6], [16]  \n  - Thus, as a booking crosses the 180-day threshold, the economic relationship between Owner and Agent changes (different commission rate and classification).\n\n- **Termination notice (60 days)**:  \n  - Once either party gives 60 days written notice, the relationship transitions into a wind-down phase: the agreement remains in effect, but both parties know it will end at the end of that 60-day period. [2], [3], [16]  \n  - Existing rental agreements remain valid even after termination, so obligations to guests/tenants may extend beyond the management agreement’s end date. [3], [16]\n\n- **5 business days notice of listing**:  \n  - When the Owner decides to list the property for sale, a new obligation arises: within 5 business days, the Owner must inform the Agent. [16]  \n  - This creates a short, early-warning window that changes the information balance between Owner and Agent at the moment the property’s status changes.\n\n**Within the Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:\n\n- **Service dates**:  \n  - Each service event is anchored to a specific date, building a chronological history of maintenance and compliance. [7], [14], [17]\n\n- **10 business days after contract change**:  \n  - When the contract is changed, the Owner’s regulatory obligation is triggered and must be fulfilled within 10 business days, marking a brief compliance window following any change. [17]\n\nAcross all documents, the pattern is that **rights, obligations, and classifications are activated, limited, or transformed by specific day-based windows**: short windows (5, 10, 60 days) for notices and filings; medium windows (60, 180 days) for performance and dispute resolution; and the 180-day threshold for rental classification.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n1. **60-day windows as operational and legal triggers**  \n   - Warranty: 60 days of special coverage for certain items; 60 days to complete repairs; 60 days to demand arbitration after a complaint. [1], [8], [18]  \n   - Property management: 60 days written notice to terminate the agreement. [2], [3], [16]  \n   These 60-day windows consistently define short but substantial periods for action (claims, repairs, dispute election, termination).\n\n2. **180-day thresholds as classification boundaries**  \n   - Warranty: 180 days as a target to conclude arbitration. [9]  \n   - Property management: 180 days as the dividing line between short-term and long-term rentals, with different fee structures. [6], [16]  \n   In both contexts, 180 days marks a significant boundary: in one, for procedural efficiency; in the other, for economic classification.\n\n3. **Short business-day windows for notice and compliance**  \n   - Property management: 5 business days for the Owner to notify the Agent of a listing agreement. [16]  \n   - Holding tank: 10 business days to file changes to the service contract with authorities. [17]  \n   These shorter windows govern prompt communication and regulatory compliance.\n\n4. **Day-based timeframes as conditions on rights and obligations**  \n   - Warranty rights (coverage and claims) exist only within 60-day or 1-year windows; repair obligations are tied to a 60-day performance period. [4], [5], [10], [18]  \n   - Management rights (to terminate, to charge certain fees) and duties (to notify) are tied to 5-, 60-, and 180-day measures. [2], [3], [6], [16]  \n   - Regulatory duties in the holding tank contract are tied to specific service dates and a 10-business-day filing window. [7], [14], [17]\n\nTogether, these show a consistent use of explicit day-based timeframes to structure when relationships start, how long they last, and when they can be changed or enforced.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the corpus, the explicit day-based timeframes are:\n\n- **5 business days** – Owner must notify Agent of a listing agreement. [16]  \n- **10 business days** – Owner must file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and County. [17]  \n- **60 days** –  \n  - Warranty coverage period for specified finish items (doors, windows, switches, etc.). [1], [8], [18]  \n  - Alternative warranty term (60 days vs. 1 year) and corresponding claim deadline. [4], [5], [10], [18]  \n  - Time for Builder to complete repairs after a written defect report. [18]  \n  - Maximum time after service of a complaint to demand arbitration. [18]  \n  - Notice period to terminate the property management agreement. [2], [3], [16]\n- **Less than 180 days** – Defines short-term/vacation rentals (25% fee). [6], [16]  \n- **More than 180 days** – Defines long-term leases (10% fee). [6], [16]  \n- **180 days** – Target period to conclude arbitration after filing a Dispute. [9]  \n- **Specific service dates** – Dates on which the holding tank was serviced, recorded in reports. [7], [14], [17]\n\nThese time windows govern when warranties apply, when claims and repairs must occur, when disputes must be arbitrated, how rentals are classified and charged, when agreements can be terminated, and how quickly regulatory filings and notifications must be made. Collectively, they define the temporal structure of the parties’ rights and obligations across the contracts.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\nBelow, each sub-question is addressed in order, using only **explicit day-based timeframes** (i.e., periods expressed in days) from the provided documents.\n\n---\n\n### 1. What explicit day-based timeframes can be identified?\n\nAcross the documents, the following explicit day-based timeframes (in days) appear:\n\n**From the Builders Limited Warranty** (doc_e0583fe312dc41439f5abae608cb9f9e):\n\n1. **Sixty (60) days – defect-free warranty for certain items**  \n   - Doors (including hardware), windows, electric switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking around exterior openings, plumbing fixtures, and cabinet work are warranted to be free of defects in materials or workmanship “for a period of sixty (60) days.” [1], [8], [18]\n\n2. **Sixty (60) day warranty period – as an alternative to one (1) year**  \n   - The warranty terms terminate “one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement.” [5], [10], [18]  \n   - Claims not made in writing “prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable” are excluded. [4], [18]  \n   - Notification of defects must be made “prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable.” [18]\n\n3. **Sixty (60) days – time for the Builder to complete repairs**  \n   - After receiving a written report of a covered defect, the Builder will “repair or replace it at no charge … within sixty (60) days (longer if weather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages cause delays).” [18]\n\n4. **Not more than 60 days – deadline to demand arbitration after service of a complaint**  \n   - A party may demand arbitration “not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.” [18]\n\n5. **180 days – target to conclude arbitration**  \n   - The parties agree “to take any action necessary to conclude an arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator.” [9]\n\n**From the Property Management Agreement** (doc_30b15aec29f945a8af11fcaedcea6569):\n\n6. **Sixty (60) days written notice – termination of the management agreement**  \n   - Either party may terminate the agreement “upon sixty (60) days written notice.” [2], [3], [16]\n\n7. **Less than 180 days – definition of short-term/vacation rentals**  \n   - Short term and/or vacation rentals are defined as “reservations of less than 180 days.” [6], [16]\n\n8. **More than 180 days – definition of long-term leases**  \n   - Long term leases are defined as “leases of more than 180 days.” [6], [16]\n\n9. **Five (5) business days – owner’s notice of listing agreement**  \n   - The Owner must provide the Agent “written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.” [16]\n\n10. **Monthly charges (implied 30-day cycles)**  \n   - Advertising for short-term rentals is charged at “$75.00/month.” [6], [16]  \n   - Administration and accounting have a “minimum charge … at $50.00/month.” [16]  \n   These are month-based, not day-counts, so they are noted but not central to “day-based” windows.\n\n**From the Holding Tank Servicing Contract** (doc_b9d5cb189767402c85089fb9ae8279fd):\n\n11. **Ten (10) business days – deadline to file changes to the service contract**  \n   - In the event of a change, the owner must file a copy of changes or a new contract “within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract.” [17]\n\n12. **Dates of servicing – day-specific service events**  \n   - The pumper’s report must include “the dates on which the holding tank was serviced.” [7], [14], [17]  \n   These are specific calendar days of service, not fixed-length windows, but they are explicit day references.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Considering only explicit day-based timeframes, what specific entities/items/elements are tied to those timeframes?\n\nFor each timeframe, the associated entities/items/elements are:\n\n**Builders Limited Warranty**:\n\n1. **60-day defect-free coverage** [1], [8], [18]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Doors (including hardware)  \n     - Windows  \n     - Electric switches  \n     - Receptacles  \n     - Fixtures  \n     - Caulking around exterior openings  \n     - Plumbing fixtures  \n     - Cabinet work  \n   - Parties: Builder, Buyer/Owner.\n\n2. **60-day vs. 1-year warranty periods** [4], [5], [10], [18]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - All items covered by the Builder’s Limited Warranty (structural components, systems, and the 60-day items above).  \n   - Parties: Builder, Buyer/Owner.  \n   - Concept: warranty term, claim eligibility.\n\n3. **60 days to complete repairs** [18]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Defective items covered by the warranty.  \n   - Parties: Builder (performing repair/replacement), Buyer/Owner (requesting service).\n\n4. **≤ 60 days to demand arbitration after service of complaint** [18]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - “Any Dispute” arising out of the construction, purchase, warranty, or related documents.  \n   - Parties: Any of the Parties to the warranty agreement; arbitrator(s); Administrator.\n\n5. **180 days to conclude arbitration** [9]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Arbitration proceedings regarding Disputes.  \n   - Parties: The Parties to the warranty; arbitrator(s); Administrator.\n\n**Property Management Agreement**:\n\n6. **60 days written notice to terminate** [2], [3], [16]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - The Property Management Agreement itself (term/termination).  \n   - Parties: Owner (Contoso Ltd.), Agent (Walt Flood Realty).\n\n7. **< 180 days – short-term/vacation rentals** [6], [16]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Short term/vacation rental reservations.  \n     - Management fee/commission of 25% of gross revenues.  \n   - Parties: Owner, Agent, renters/guests.\n\n8. **> 180 days – long-term leases** [6], [16]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Long term leases.  \n     - Management fee/commission of 10% of gross revenues.  \n   - Parties: Owner, Agent, tenants.\n\n9. **5 business days – notice of listing agreement** [16]  \n   - Entities/items:  \n     - Listing agreement for sale of the property.  \n     - Owner’s written notification to Agent.  \n   - Parties: Owner, Agent.\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:\n\n10. **10 business days – filing changes to contract** [17]  \n    - Entities/items:  \n      - Changes to the service contract or a new service contract.  \n      - Filing with the municipality and County.  \n    - Parties: Owner, municipality, County.\n\n11. **Dates of servicing** [7], [14], [17]  \n    - Entities/items:  \n      - Service events for the holding tank (pumping).  \n      - Reports including dates, volumes, disposal sites, condition.  \n    - Parties: Pumper (Fabrikam Inc.), Owner (Contoso Ltd.), County.\n\n---\n\n### 3. What specific relationships between the identified entities/items/elements are defined by these day-based timeframes?\n\n**Builders Limited Warranty**:\n\n1. **60-day item warranty**  \n   - Relationship: For 60 days from commencement, the Builder is obligated to ensure specified finish items (doors, windows, switches, etc.) are free of defects; the Buyer/Owner is the beneficiary. [1], [8], [18]\n\n2. **1-year vs. 60-day warranty windows and claim deadlines**  \n   - Relationship:  \n     - Different categories of items have different maximum coverage periods (either 60 days or 1 year). [5], [10], [18]  \n     - The Buyer/Owner must submit written claims within the applicable period (1 year or 60 days); otherwise, claims are excluded. [4], [18]  \n   - This creates a time-bound relationship between coverage, claim rights, and item category.\n\n3. **60 days to complete repairs**  \n   - Relationship: Once a covered defect is reported in writing, the Builder must repair/replace within 60 days (subject to certain delays). [18]  \n   - This ties the Builder’s performance obligation to a 60-day service window.\n\n4. **≤ 60 days to demand arbitration after complaint**  \n   - Relationship: After service of a complaint or related pleading, any party has up to 60 days to demand arbitration; failure to do so within that window may affect the right to compel arbitration. [18]\n\n5. **180 days to conclude arbitration**  \n   - Relationship: The Parties and arbitrator(s) are expected to act so that arbitration is concluded within 180 days of filing the Dispute, linking procedural conduct to a 180-day target. [9]\n\n**Property Management Agreement**:\n\n6. **60 days written notice to terminate**  \n   - Relationship: Either Owner or Agent may end the management relationship by giving 60 days written notice; the agreement continues in force during that 60-day period. [2], [3], [16]\n\n7. **< 180 days vs. > 180 days – rental classification and fees**  \n   - Relationship:  \n     - Reservations of less than 180 days are “short term and/or vacation rentals” and incur a 25% management fee. [6], [16]  \n     - Leases of more than 180 days are “long term leases” and incur a 10% management fee. [6], [16]  \n   - The length of the rental in days directly determines the fee structure and classification of the tenancy.\n\n8. **5 business days – notice of listing**  \n   - Relationship: If the property is listed for sale, the Owner must notify the Agent within 5 business days, linking the Owner’s sales activity to a prompt disclosure obligation to the Agent. [16]\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:\n\n9. **10 business days – filing changes**  \n   - Relationship: When the service contract changes, the Owner must file the updated contract with the municipality and County within 10 business days, tying regulatory compliance to a 10-day filing window. [17]\n\n10. **Dates of servicing**  \n    - Relationship: Each service event (pumping) is recorded with its specific date, volume, disposal site, and condition, forming a time-stamped compliance and maintenance record between Pumper, Owner, and County. [7], [14], [17]\n\n---\n\n### 4. How do the entities and their relationships change or evolve across these explicit day-based timeframes?\n\n**Within the Builders Limited Warranty**:\n\n- **From commencement to 60 days**:  \n  - The Buyer/Owner has full coverage for both structural systems (1-year items) and the special 60-day items (doors, windows, etc.). [1], [8], [18]  \n  - The Buyer/Owner may discover defects and must be prepared to submit written claims; any 60-day-only items must be claimed within this period. [4], [18]  \n  - If a defect is reported, the Builder has up to 60 days to repair/replace, so a defect reported on day 30 could be addressed up to day 90. [18]\n\n- **From 60 days to 1 year**:  \n  - Coverage for the 60-day items expires; only the 1-year items remain covered. [5], [10], [18]  \n  - The Buyer/Owner can still submit claims for 1-year items until the 1-year mark; after that, claims are barred. [4], [18]\n\n- **Arbitration-related evolution**:  \n  - After a complaint is served, there is a 60-day window to demand arbitration. [18]  \n  - Once a Dispute is filed with the Administrator, the parties aim to conclude arbitration within 180 days, so the dispute resolution process is expected to move from filing to decision within that 180-day arc. [9]\n\n**Within the Property Management Agreement**:\n\n- **Rental duration thresholds (<180 vs. >180 days)**:  \n  - A reservation’s length in days determines whether it is treated as short-term (higher fee, 25%) or long-term (lower fee, 10%). [6], [16]  \n  - Thus, as a booking crosses the 180-day threshold, the economic relationship between Owner and Agent changes (different commission rate and classification).\n\n- **Termination notice (60 days)**:  \n  - Once either party gives 60 days written notice, the relationship transitions into a wind-down phase: the agreement remains in effect, but both parties know it will end at the end of that 60-day period. [2], [3], [16]  \n  - Existing rental agreements remain valid even after termination, so obligations to guests/tenants may extend beyond the management agreement’s end date. [3], [16]\n\n- **5 business days notice of listing**:  \n  - When the Owner decides to list the property for sale, a new obligation arises: within 5 business days, the Owner must inform the Agent. [16]  \n  - This creates a short, early-warning window that changes the information balance between Owner and Agent at the moment the property’s status changes.\n\n**Within the Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:\n\n- **Service dates**:  \n  - Each service event is anchored to a specific date, building a chronological history of maintenance and compliance. [7], [14], [17]\n\n- **10 business days after contract change**:  \n  - When the contract is changed, the Owner’s regulatory obligation is triggered and must be fulfilled within 10 business days, marking a brief compliance window following any change. [17]\n\nAcross all documents, the pattern is that **rights, obligations, and classifications are activated, limited, or transformed by specific day-based windows**: short windows (5, 10, 60 days) for notices and filings; medium windows (60, 180 days) for performance and dispute resolution; and the 180-day threshold for rental classification.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n1. **60-day windows as operational and legal triggers**  \n   - Warranty: 60 days of special coverage for certain items; 60 days to complete repairs; 60 days to demand arbitration after a complaint. [1], [8], [18]  \n   - Property management: 60 days written notice to terminate the agreement. [2], [3], [16]  \n   These 60-day windows consistently define short but substantial periods for action (claims, repairs, dispute election, termination).\n\n2. **180-day thresholds as classification boundaries**  \n   - Warranty: 180 days as a target to conclude arbitration. [9]  \n   - Property management: 180 days as the dividing line between short-term and long-term rentals, with different fee structures. [6], [16]  \n   In both contexts, 180 days marks a significant boundary: in one, for procedural efficiency; in the other, for economic classification.\n\n3. **Short business-day windows for notice and compliance**  \n   - Property management: 5 business days for the Owner to notify the Agent of a listing agreement. [16]  \n   - Holding tank: 10 business days to file changes to the service contract with authorities. [17]  \n   These shorter windows govern prompt communication and regulatory compliance.\n\n4. **Day-based timeframes as conditions on rights and obligations**  \n   - Warranty rights (coverage and claims) exist only within 60-day or 1-year windows; repair obligations are tied to a 60-day performance period. [4], [5], [10], [18]  \n   - Management rights (to terminate, to charge certain fees) and duties (to notify) are tied to 5-, 60-, and 180-day measures. [2], [3], [6], [16]  \n   - Regulatory duties in the holding tank contract are tied to specific service dates and a 10-business-day filing window. [7], [14], [17]\n\nTogether, these show a consistent use of explicit day-based timeframes to structure when relationships start, how long they last, and when they can be changed or enforced.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the corpus, the explicit day-based timeframes are:\n\n- **5 business days** – Owner must notify Agent of a listing agreement. [16]  \n- **10 business days** – Owner must file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and County. [17]  \n- **60 days** –  \n  - Warranty coverage period for specified finish items (doors, windows, switches, etc.). [1], [8], [18]  \n  - Alternative warranty term (60 days vs. 1 year) and corresponding claim deadline. [4], [5], [10], [18]  \n  - Time for Builder to complete repairs after a written defect report. [18]  \n  - Maximum time after service of a complaint to demand arbitration. [18]  \n  - Notice period to terminate the property management agreement. [2], [3], [16]\n- **Less than 180 days** – Defines short-term/vacation rentals (25% fee). [6], [16]  \n- **More than 180 days** – Defines long-term leases (10% fee). [6], [16]  \n- **180 days** – Target period to conclude arbitration after filing a Dispute. [9]  \n- **Specific service dates** – Dates on which the holding tank was serviced, recorded in reports. [7], [14], [17]\n\nThese time windows govern when warranties apply, when claims and repairs must occur, when disputes must be arbitrated, how rentals are classified and charged, when agreements can be terminated, and how quickly regulatory filings and notifications must be made. Collectively, they define the temporal structure of the parties’ rights and obligations across the contracts.",

[16]  \n- **10 business days** – Owner must file any changes to the holding‑tank service contract with the municipality and county within ten business days of the change. [4][17]  \n- **60 days**  \n  - Builder’s warranty coverage for specified items (doors, windows, switches, etc.). [1][8][18]  \n  - Termination of limited warranty for those items 60 days after commencement. [5][8][10][18]  \n  - Deadline to submit claims for those items (within 60 days). [5][6][10][18]  \n  - Builder’s obligation to complete covered repairs within 60 days of receiving written notice. [7][18]  \n  - Arbitration demand must be made not more than 60 days after service of a complaint or related pleading. [9]  \n  - Either party may terminate the property management agreement with 60 days’ written notice. [2][3][16]\n\n- **180 days**  \n  - Target to conclude arbitration within 180 days of filing a dispute. [9]  \n  - Threshold distinguishing short‑term/vacation rentals (less than 180 days) from long‑term leases (more than 180 days). [6][16]\n\n- **1 year / twelve months**  \n  - Builder’s 1‑year warranty for structural components and major systems. [11][18]  \n  - Termination of that warranty 1 year after commencement, and requirement that claims be made within that year. [5][6][10][18]  \n  - Property management agreement’s initial 12‑month term and successive one‑year renewals. [2][3][16]\n\nThese are all the explicit day‑based timeframes specified in the cited documents, and together they constitute the “time windows” across the set.",

Property Management Agreement – explicit day‑based timeframes\n\nFrom the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:\n\n- Initial term and renewals (year‑based, but relevant as a time window)  \n  - “This agreement shall be for an initial period of twelve months beginning on: 2010‑06‑15 and shall be automatically renewed for successive one year terms thereafter.” [2][3][16]\n\n- Termination notice window  \n  - “However, either party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement.” [2][3][16]\n\n- Owner notice of listing for sale  \n  - Owner must “Provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.” [16]\n\n- Duration thresholds for rental types (day‑count thresholds)  \n  - Short‑term/vacation rentals: “reservations of less than 180 days.” [6][16]  \n  - Long‑term leases: “leases of more than 180 days.” [6][16]\n\nThese define explicit day‑based windows: 60 days (termination notice), 5 business days (owner notice), and 180‑day thresholds distinguishing rental types.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Holding Tank Servicing Contract – explicit day‑based timeframes\n\nFrom the **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**:\n\n- Contract duration  \n  - “This agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract.” [12][17]\n\n- Deadline to file changes with municipality/county  \n  - “In the event of a change in this contract, the owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the County named above within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract.” [4][17]\n\n- Reporting content includes dates of service (day‑specific records, not a window)  \n  - The pumper’s report must include “The dates on which the holding tank was serviced” [7][14][17], but this is descriptive, not a required timeframe for action.\n\nThe only explicit day‑based window here is the 10 business‑day deadline to file contract changes.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Other documents in the corpus\n\n- **purchase_contract** and **contoso_lifts_invoice** are listed in the corpus index but no time‑window excerpts are provided in the evidence, so no day‑based timeframes can be reliably extracted from them under the citation requirement.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **60‑day windows**  \n  - Builder’s warranty: 60‑day coverage for certain items [1][8][18]; 60‑day outer limit to file claims for those items [5][10][18]; 60‑day period to complete repairs [7][18]; and a “not more than 60 days” window after service of a complaint to demand arbitration [9].  \n  - Property management: 60‑day written‑notice window to terminate the agreement [2][3][16].  \n  These show 60 days used both as a short warranty/repair period and as a standard notice period.\n\n- **One‑year / twelve‑month windows**  \n  - Builder’s warranty: 1‑year coverage for major systems and structure [11][18], with claims required within that 1‑year period [5][6][10][18].  \n  - Property management: initial 12‑month term and automatic 1‑year renewals [2][3][16].  \n  Both use a one‑year window as the primary contract or coverage period.\n\n- **Short administrative deadlines (5–10 business days)**  \n  - Property management: Owner must notify Agent of a listing “within five (5) business days” [16].  \n  - Holding tank: Owner must file contract changes “within ten (10) business days” [4][17].  \n  Both impose short business‑day windows for compliance with administrative/notification duties.\n\n- **Longer procedural window (180 days)**  \n  - Builder’s warranty arbitration: parties aim to conclude arbitration “within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute” [9].  \n  - Property management: 180 days is used as a threshold to distinguish short‑term vs. long‑term rentals [6][16].  \n  In both, 180 days marks a boundary between shorter and longer processes/commitments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the provided contracts, the explicit day‑based timeframes (“time windows”) are:\n\n- **5 business days** – Owner must notify Agent of a property listing within five business days. [16]  \n- **10 business days** – Owner must file any changes to the holding‑tank service contract with the municipality and county within ten business days of the change. [4][17]  \n- **60 days**  \n  - Builder’s warranty coverage for specified items (doors, windows, switches, etc.). [1][8][18]  \n  - Termination of limited warranty for those items 60 days after commencement. [5][8][10][18]  \n  - Deadline to submit claims for those items (within 60 days). [5][6][10][18]  \n  - Builder’s obligation to complete covered repairs within 60 days of receiving written notice. [7][18]  \n  - Arbitration demand must be made not more than 60 days after service of a complaint or related pleading. [9]  \n  - Either party may terminate the property management agreement with 60 days’ written notice. [2][3][16]\n\n- **180 days**  \n  - Target to conclude arbitration within 180 days of filing a dispute. [9]  \n  - Threshold distinguishing short‑term/vacation rentals (less than 180 days) from long‑term leases (more than 180 days). [6][16]\n\n- **1 year / twelve months**  \n  - Builder’s 1‑year warranty for structural components and major systems. [11][18]  \n  - Termination of that warranty 1 year after commencement, and requirement that claims be made within that year. [5][6][10][18]  \n  - Property management agreement’s initial 12‑month term and successive one‑year renewals. [2][3][16]\n\nThese are all the explicit day‑based timeframes specified in the cited documents, and together they constitute the “time windows” across the set.",

Which documents mention **insurance**?\n\nReviewing the provided documents:\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n  - Explicitly mentions “Liability Insurance coverage” and “insurance policy” and “certificate of insurance.” [4][5]  \n  - Also refers to an “insured financial institution,” but that is about the bank account, not an insurance policy. [7]\n\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**  \n  - Discusses warranties, exclusions, bodily injury, and property damage, but does **not** mention any insurance policy, insurance coverage, or insurance limits. The term “insurance” does not appear in the excerpts. [2][6][8][9][11][12][14][15][17][18]\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**  \n  - Contains no references to insurance, insurance coverage, or insurance limits. [3]\n\n**Therefore, only the PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT mentions insurance.** [4][5]\n\n---\n\n### 2. For each document that mentions insurance, what **limits** related to insurance are specified?\n\nSince only the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** mentions insurance, we look there for specified limits:\n\n- Under “RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER,” the Owner must:  \n  - “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with **minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury** and **$25,000 for property damage to others**.” [4][5]\n\nThese are explicit insurance limits tied to the required liability insurance policy.\n\nNo other document specifies any insurance limits:\n\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**:  \n  - Mentions “Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property” only as an exclusion from warranty coverage, not as an insurance requirement or limit.

Which documents mention **insurance**?\n\nReviewing the provided documents:\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n  - Explicitly mentions “Liability Insurance coverage” and “insurance policy” and “certificate of insurance.” [4][5]  \n  - Also refers to an “insured financial institution,” but that is about the bank account, not an insurance policy. [7]\n\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**  \n  - Discusses warranties, exclusions, bodily injury, and property damage, but does **not** mention any insurance policy, insurance coverage, or insurance limits. The term “insurance” does not appear in the excerpts.

Which documents mention **insurance**?\n\n- **Property Management Agreement**  \n  - Explicitly mentions “Liability Insurance coverage” and “insurance policy” and “certificate of insurance.” [6][7]  \n- **Builders Limited Warranty**  \n  - Uses the word “Limited Warranty” extensively, but does **not** refer to insurance or insurance policies/coverage/limits. The only “limits” here are warranty terms and exclusions, not insurance limits. [2][4][8][11][16]  \n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**  \n  - Contains no references to insurance, insurance policies, or coverage limits. [3]\n\n**Therefore, only the Property Management Agreement mentions insurance.**  \n\n---\n\n### 2. For each document that mentions insurance, what **limits** related to insurance are specified?\n\n#### Property Management Agreement\n\nUnder “RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER,” the Owner must:\n\n- “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with **minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury** and **$25,000 for property damage to others**.” [6][7]\n\nThese are explicit insurance limits:\n- Bodily injury liability: **$300,000** minimum. [6][7]  \n- Property damage liability to others: **$25,000** minimum. [6][7]  \n\nNo other numerical insurance limits are specified in this document.\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty and the Holding Tank Servicing Contract do not specify any insurance limits:\n- Builders Limited Warranty: discusses warranty periods (one year, sixty days) and exclusions, but not insurance coverage or limits. [2][8][16]  \n- Holding Tank Servicing Contract: focuses on servicing obligations, reporting, and contract duration; no insurance terms. [3]\n\n---\n\n### 3. What limits “are specified”? (Clarifying the fragment)\n\nInterpreting the fragment “are specified?” as asking which specific insurance limits are given:\n\n- The only specified insurance limits are in the Property Management Agreement:  \n  - **$300,000** minimum liability coverage for bodily injury. [6][7]  \n  - **$25,000** minimum liability coverage for property damage to others. [6][7]  \n\nNo other document specifies any insurance-related dollar limits.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Where are the specified **insurance limits** located?\n\nWithin the **Property Management Agreement**:\n\n- Section: **RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER. Owner agrees to and shall:** [6]  \n- Subsection **(f)**:  \n  - “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured and shall be furnished with a copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance.” [6][7]\n\nSo, the insurance limits are located:\n- In the **Owner’s responsibilities** section, specifically clause **(f)** of that section. [6][7]  \n\nNo other locations in any document contain insurance limits.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Sub-question 1 (which documents mention insurance?)** narrows the scope to the **Property Management Agreement** as the only relevant document. [6][7]  \n- **Sub-question 2 (what limits are specified?)** then focuses on that document and identifies the concrete dollar amounts: $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. [6][7]  \n- **Sub-question 3 (are specified?)** is effectively a restatement asking for the exact limits, which are the same two amounts above. [6][7]  \n- **Sub-question 4 (where are the limits located?)** ties the answer back to the document structure: Owner’s Responsibilities, clause (f), in the Property Management Agreement. [6][7]  \n\nTogether, these steps show that:\n- Only one document is relevant to insurance.\n- It clearly sets minimum liability limits and requires naming the Agent as an additional insured and providing policy/certificate copies. [6][7]\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn response to the original query, “Which documents mention **insurance** and what limits are specified?”:\n\n- **Document that mentions insurance:**  \n  - **Property Management Agreement**. [6][7]\n\n- **Specified insurance limits in that document (and where):**  \n  - Under **RESPONSIBILITIES OF OWNER, clause (f)**, the Owner must:  \n    - Provide liability insurance with **minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury**. [6][7]  \n    - Provide liability insurance with **minimum limits of $25,000 for property damage to others**. [6][7]  \n    - Name the Agent as an additional insured and furnish a copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance. [6][7]\n\n- **Other documents:**  \n  - **Builders Limited Warranty** and **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** do **not** mention insurance or specify insurance limits. [2][3][8][11][16]",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. How “coverage start” is defined\n\nThe warranty explicitly defines when coverage begins in the “Term” section:\n\n- “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on **the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first**.” [5], [13]\n\nThis means:\n\n- There are two possible trigger events:\n  1. The **date of final settlement** (i.e., closing/settlement on the home), and  \n  2. The **date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**.  \n- The warranty coverage **starts on the earlier of those two dates** (“whichever comes first”). [5], [13]\n\nThis “coverage start” rule applies to “the various coverages” under the Builder’s Limited Warranty, including:\n- The **one‑year** coverage for structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, and roof. [1], [10]\n- The **60‑day** coverage for doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, and certain cabinet/plumbing items. [1], [3], [13]\n\nAll of these coverage periods “begin” at the same defined start point: the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [5], [13]\n\n### 2. What must happen before coverage ends (end‑of‑coverage triggers)\n\nThe warranty describes several conditions and events that determine when coverage ends.\n\n#### a. Time‑limit expiration after commencement\n\nThe primary end point is the passage of the stated time periods after coverage begins:\n\n- “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate **one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**.” [5], [6]\n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [5], [6]\n\nThus:\n\n- For items with **one‑year coverage**, the warranty ends **one year after the coverage start date**. [1], [5], [6], [10]\n- For items with **60‑day coverage**, the warranty ends **60 days after the coverage start date**. [1], [3], [5], [6], [13]\n- After those periods, any claims not made in writing as required are “not covered,” which functionally ends coverage for those items. [5], [6]\n\n#### b. Requirement to submit written claims before the period ends\n\nThe warranty imposes a procedural condition that must be satisfied before the end of the applicable period:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner “must, **prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable**, write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested…” [4], [6]\n\nIf this does not occur:\n\n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [5], [6]\n- The exclusions section reiterates: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable” are excluded. [8]\n\nSo, for coverage to be effective before it ends:\n\n- The defect must arise within the applicable time period, and  \n- The Buyer/Owner must **send a written claim by certified mail before that period expires**. [4], [6], [8]\n\nIf that written notice is not sent in time, coverage for that claim is treated as ended, even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. [5], [6]\n\n#### c. Automatic termination upon sale or move‑out\n\nThe warranty also ends if the original Buyer/Owner no longer owns or occupies the home:\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is **not transferable**.” [7], [16]\n- “In the event the first purchaser **sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates**.” [7], [16]\n\nThus, coverage ends immediately if:\n\n- The first purchaser **sells** the home, or  \n- The first purchaser **moves out** of the home,  \neven if the one‑year or 60‑day time periods have not yet expired. [7], [16]\n\n#### d. Other practical limitations related to coverage ending\n\nWhile not separate “end” triggers, several provisions effectively limit coverage before or at the end of the period:\n\n- **Exclusion of late claims**: Claims not made in writing before the end of the applicable period are excluded. [5], [6], [8]\n- **Emergency notice requirement**: Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency “relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.” [9], [14] This does not change the calendar end date, but it can end coverage for that emergency‑related damage.\n- **Scope exclusions**: Many types of damage or defects are excluded (e.g., wear and tear, acts of God, owner‑installed items, etc.), meaning those are never covered even within the time period. [4], [8], [15], [17]\n\nThese do not redefine the coverage end date, but they define what is or is not covered up to that end.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **start** of coverage is tied to a specific, earliest event: final settlement or first occupancy, whichever occurs first. [5], [13]\n- The **end** of coverage is primarily determined by:\n  - The **elapsed time** from that start (one year or 60 days, depending on the item). [1], [3], [5], [6], [10], [13]\n  - The **procedural requirement** that written claims be made before that time expires. [4], [5], [6], [8]\n  - The **status of the original Buyer/Owner**: if they sell or move out, the warranty automatically terminates, regardless of remaining time. [7], [16]\n\nTogether, these provisions mean:\n\n- Coverage is a **fixed-duration, non‑transferable** warranty that begins at the earlier of settlement or occupancy and ends at the earlier of:\n  - The expiration of the applicable one‑year or 60‑day period (with timely written notice required for claims), or  \n  - The first purchaser’s sale of or move‑out from the home. [5], [6], [7], [16]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this warranty, “coverage start” is defined as the date the warranty “commences,” which is the **earlier of the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**. [5], [13] Coverage then runs for **one year** for major structural and system components and **60 days** for specified items, measured from that start date. [1], [3], [5], [6], [10], [13]\n\nCoverage ends when the applicable **one‑year or 60‑day period** has elapsed after commencement, and any claim not made **in writing by certified mail before that period ends** is not covered. [4], [5], [6], [8] Additionally, the warranty is **not transferable**, and it **automatically terminates** if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, even if time remains in the original period.

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. How “coverage start” is defined\n\nThe warranty explicitly defines when its various coverages begin in the “Term” section:\n\n- “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on **the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first**.” [2. Term A; see [5], [13]]\n\nThis means:\n\n- There are two possible trigger events:\n  1. The **date of final settlement** (i.e., closing/settlement of the purchase), and  \n  2. The **date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**.  \n- The warranty coverage **starts on the earlier of those two dates** (“whichever comes first”). [5], [13]\n\nNo additional actions (like separate registration) are required in the text to start coverage; it begins automatically on that earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [5], [13]\n\n### 2. What must happen before coverage ends (end-of-coverage triggers)\n\nThe warranty describes several ways coverage can end, including time limits and specific events.\n\n#### a. Time-based termination of coverage\n\nThe warranty sets fixed durations for different types of coverage:\n\n- **One-year coverage**: For structural components (floors, ceilings, walls, internal structural components, plumbing including septic if installed by Builder, heating, electric wiring, and roof), the Builder “warrants for a period of one (1) year” that these will be free of defects in materials or workmanship. [1], [10]\n- **Sixty-day coverage**: For doors (including hardware), windows, electric switches, receptacles, fixtures, and certain caulking and cabinet work, the Builder “warrants … for a period of sixty (60) days” that these will be free of defects in materials or workmanship. [1], [3], [13]\n\nThe “Term” section then ties these durations to the coverage start:\n\n- “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate **one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**.” [2. Term B; see [5], [6], [13]]\n\nThus, once coverage has commenced (on the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy), it will automatically end:\n\n- **One year after commencement** for the one‑year items, and  \n- **Sixty days after commencement** for the sixty‑day items. [5], [6], [13]\n\nAdditionally, the warranty states:\n\n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [5], [6]\n\nThis means that, for coverage to apply:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner must **make a written claim within the applicable one‑year or sixty‑day period**; otherwise, the claim is outside coverage even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. [5], [6]\n\nThe notification section reinforces this:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner must, “**prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable**, write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested.” [6], [4]\n\nSo, time-based end of coverage occurs when:\n\n1. The applicable **one-year or sixty-day period after commencement expires**, and  \n2. Any claim not made in writing before that expiration is expressly “not covered.” [5], [6], [4]\n\n#### b. Transfer/occupancy-based termination\n\nThe warranty also ends if the original Buyer/Owner no longer owns or occupies the home:\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the **first purchaser** of the home and is **not transferable**.” [8], [16]\n- “In the event the first purchaser **sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates**.” [7], [16]\n\nThus, coverage ends immediately upon either of these events, even if the one‑year or sixty‑day time period has not yet expired:\n\n- **Sale of the home by the first purchaser**, or  \n- **The first purchaser moving out of the home**. [7], [16]\n\n#### c. Claim and notice-related limitations\n\nWhile not separate “end dates,” certain conditions effectively cut off coverage for particular issues:\n\n- Any and all claims not made in writing “prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable” are excluded. [8], [5], [6]\n- Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency “relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages” related to that emergency. [6], [9], [14]\n\nThese provisions mean that, even before the general warranty term ends, coverage for a specific defect can be lost if:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner does not send the required **written notice within the applicable warranty period**; or  \n- In an emergency, the Buyer/Owner fails to promptly notify the Builder, which relieves the Builder of liability for that emergency-related damage. [6], [8], [9], [14]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **start of coverage** is tied to a specific, objective event: the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [5], [13]  \n- The **end of coverage** is then calculated from that start date: one year or sixty days “after commencement,” depending on the item. [5], [6], [13]\n- The requirement that claims be made in writing **before the end of the applicable period** links the time-based term directly to the claim process: if the written claim is not made within that one‑year or sixty‑day window, the issue is “not covered,” regardless of when discovered. [5], [6], [4], [8]\n- Separately, the warranty’s **non-transferability** and automatic termination upon sale or move-out create additional end-of-coverage triggers that can cut off coverage even before the time period expires. [7], [8], [16]\n- Emergency-notice requirements further limit coverage for specific situations if prompt notice is not given, even within the term. [6], [9], [14]\n\nTogether, these provisions define a clear sequence: coverage begins at the earlier of settlement or occupancy, runs for fixed periods (one year or sixty days), but can end earlier if the first purchaser sells or moves out, or if required notices are not given in time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this warranty, “coverage start” is defined as the date the warranty “commences,” which is the **earlier of the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**. [5], [13] Coverage then runs for **one year** for major structural and system components and **sixty days** for specified items, and it **ends** when the applicable one‑year or sixty‑day period after that commencement date expires, unless otherwise provided. [1], [3], [5], [6], [13] Coverage also **automatically terminates** earlier if the first purchaser **sells the home or moves out**, because the warranty is not transferable. [7], [8], [16] Additionally, for any particular defect to be covered, the Buyer/Owner must **submit a written claim before the applicable period ends**, and failure to promptly report emergencies can relieve the Builder of liability for those emergency-related damages.

one year after commencement for the oneyear items and - sixty days after commencement for the sixtyday items. 5 6 13 additionally the warranty states: - any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered. 5 6 this means that for coverage to apply: - the buyer/owner must make a written claim within the applicable oneyear or sixtyday period otherwise the claim is outside coverage even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. 5 6 the notification section reinforces this: - the buyer/owner must prior to the termination of the one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable write a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested. 6 4 so time-based end of coverage occurs when: 1. the applicable one-year or sixty-day period after commencement expires and 2. any claim not made in writing before that expiration is expressly not covered. 5 6 4  b. transfer/occupancy-based termination the warranty also ends if the original buyer/owner no longer owns or occupies the home: - this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. 8 16 - in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates. 7 16 thus coverage ends immediately upon either of these events even if the oneyear or sixtyday time period has not yet expired: -

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. How “coverage start” is defined\n\nThe warranty explicitly defines when its various coverages begin in the “Term” section:\n\n- “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on **the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first**.” [2. Term A; see [5], [13]]\n\nThis means:\n\n- There are two possible trigger events:\n  1. The **date of final settlement** (i.e., closing/settlement of the purchase), and  \n  2. The **date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**.  \n- The warranty coverage **starts on the earlier of those two dates** (“whichever comes first”). [5], [13]\n\nNo additional actions (like separate registration) are required in the text to start coverage; it begins automatically on that earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [5], [13]\n\n### 2. What must happen before coverage ends (end-of-coverage triggers)\n\nThe warranty describes several ways coverage can end, including time limits and specific events.\n\n#### a. Time-based termination of coverage\n\nThe warranty sets fixed durations for different types of coverage:\n\n- **One-year coverage**: For structural components (floors, ceilings, walls, internal structural components, plumbing including septic if installed by Builder, heating, electric wiring, and roof), the Builder “warrants for a period of one (1) year” that these will be free of defects in materials or workmanship. [1], [10]\n- **Sixty-day coverage**: For doors (including hardware), windows, electric switches, receptacles, fixtures, and certain caulking and cabinet work, the Builder “warrants … for a period of sixty (60) days” that these will be free of defects in materials or workmanship. [1], [3], [13]\n\nThe “Term” section then ties these durations to the coverage start:\n\n- “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate **one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**.” [2. Term B; see [5], [6], [13]]\n\nThus, once coverage has commenced (on the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy), it will automatically end:\n\n- **One year after commencement** for the one‑year items, and  \n- **Sixty days after commencement** for the sixty‑day items. [5], [6], [13]\n\nAdditionally, the warranty states:\n\n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [5], [6]\n\nThis means that, for coverage to apply:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner must **make a written claim within the applicable one‑year or sixty‑day period**; otherwise, the claim is outside coverage even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. [5], [6]\n\nThe notification section reinforces this:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner must, “**prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable**, write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested.” [6], [4]\n\nSo, time-based end of coverage occurs when:\n\n1. The applicable **one-year or sixty-day period after commencement expires**, and  \n2. Any claim not made in writing before that expiration is expressly “not covered.” [5], [6], [4]\n\n#### b. Transfer/occupancy-based termination\n\nThe warranty also ends if the original Buyer/Owner no longer owns or occupies the home:\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the **first purchaser** of the home and is **not transferable**.” [8], [16]\n- “In the event the first purchaser **sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates**.” [7], [16]\n\nThus, coverage ends immediately upon either of these events, even if the one‑year or sixty‑day time period has not yet expired:\n\n- **Sale of the home by the first purchaser**, or  \n- **The first purchaser moving out of the home**. [7], [16]\n\n#### c. Claim and notice-related limitations\n\nWhile not separate “end dates,” certain conditions effectively cut off coverage for particular issues:\n\n- Any and all claims not made in writing “prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable” are excluded. [8], [5], [6]\n- Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency “relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages” related to that emergency. [6], [9], [14]\n\nThese provisions mean that, even before the general warranty term ends, coverage for a specific defect can be lost if:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner does not send the required **written notice within the applicable warranty period**; or  \n- In an emergency, the Buyer/Owner fails to promptly notify the Builder, which relieves the Builder of liability for that emergency-related damage. [6], [8], [9], [14]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **start of coverage** is tied to a specific, objective event: the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [5], [13]  \n- The **end of coverage** is then calculated from that start date: one year or sixty days “after commencement,” depending on the item. [5], [6], [13]\n- The requirement that claims be made in writing **before the end of the applicable period** links the time-based term directly to the claim process: if the written claim is not made within that one‑year or sixty‑day window, the issue is “not covered,” regardless of when discovered. [5], [6], [4], [8]\n- Separately, the warranty’s **non-transferability** and automatic termination upon sale or move-out create additional end-of-coverage triggers that can cut off coverage even before the time period expires. [7], [8], [16]\n- Emergency-notice requirements further limit coverage for specific situations if prompt notice is not given, even within the term. [6], [9], [14]\n\nTogether, these provisions define a clear sequence: coverage begins at the earlier of settlement or occupancy, runs for fixed periods (one year or sixty days), but can end earlier if the first purchaser sells or moves out, or if required notices are not given in time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this warranty, “coverage start” is defined as the date the warranty “commences,” which is the **earlier of the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**. [5], [13] Coverage then runs for **one year** for major structural and system components and **sixty days** for specified items, and it **ends** when the applicable one‑year or sixty‑day period after that commencement date expires, unless otherwise provided. [1], [3], [5], [6], [13] Coverage also **automatically terminates** earlier if the first purchaser **sells the home or moves out**, because the warranty is not transferable. [7], [8], [16] Additionally, for any particular defect to be covered, the Buyer/Owner must **submit a written claim before the applicable period ends**, and failure to promptly report emergencies can relieve the Builder of liability for those emergency-related damages.

How “coverage start” is defined\n\nThe warranty explicitly defines when coverage begins in the “Term” section:\n\n- “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on **the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first**.” [5], [13]\n\nThis means:\n\n- There are two possible trigger events:\n  1. The **date of final settlement** (i.e., closing/settlement of the purchase), and  \n  2. The **date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**.  \n- The warranty coverage **starts on the earlier of those two dates** (“whichever comes first”). [5], [13]\n\nThis “coverage start” rule applies to “the various coverages” under the Builder’s Limited Warranty, including:\n- The **one‑year** coverage for structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, and roof. [1], [10]\n- The **60‑day** coverage for doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, and cabinet work. [1], [3], [13]\n\nAll of these coverages “begin” on that same commencement date defined above. [5], [13]\n\n### 2. What must happen before coverage ends\n\nThe warranty describes several conditions and events that determine when coverage ends or when claims are no longer covered.\n\n#### a. Time‑based termination of coverage\n\nThe warranty sets fixed durations from the commencement date:\n\n- “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate **one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**.” [5], [6]  \n- It further states: “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [5], [6]\n\nThus, for coverage to apply:\n\n- The relevant warranty period must **not yet have expired**:\n  - 1‑year period for the items listed in §1.A. [1], [10]\n  - 60‑day period for the items listed in §1.B. [1], [3]\n- A **written claim** must be made **within that 1‑year or 60‑day period**, or the claim is “not covered,” even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. [5], [6], [8]\n\nThe notification section reinforces this:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner “must, **prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable, write a letter describing the defect** to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested…” [4], [6]\n\nSo, coverage effectively ends for a particular defect if:\n\n1. The applicable time period (1 year or 60 days from commencement) has passed, **or**  \n2. The Buyer/Owner fails to submit a written claim within that period. [5], [6], [8]\n\n#### b. Automatic termination upon sale or move‑out\n\nThe warranty also ends based on certain ownership/occupancy events:\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is **not transferable**.” [7], [16]  \n- “In the event the first purchaser **sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates**.” [7], [16]\n\nTherefore, coverage ends immediately if:\n\n- The original Buyer/Owner **sells the home**, or  \n- The original Buyer/Owner **moves out of the home**,  \n\neven if the 1‑year or 60‑day time period has not yet expired. [7], [16]\n\n#### c. Exclusions and failure to notify\n\nWhile exclusions do not change the formal “term,” they function as conditions that can prevent coverage from applying:\n\n- Any and all claims **not made in writing** before the end of the applicable 1‑year or 60‑day period are excluded: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.” [8]\n- Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency “**relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages**.” [9], [14]\n\nThese provisions mean that, even within the time period, coverage will not apply if:\n\n- The claim is not made in writing within the applicable period. [5], [6], [8]  \n- In an emergency, the Buyer/Owner fails to promptly notify the Builder, which cuts off the Builder’s liability for that emergency‑related damage. [9], [14]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **start of coverage** is tied to a single “commencement” date: the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy.

            "text_norm": " analysis  1. how coverage start is defined the warranty explicitly defines when coverage begins in the term section: - the terms of the various coverages of this builders limited warranty begin on the date of final settlement or the date when the buyer/owner first occupies the home whichever comes first. 5 13 this means: - there are two possible trigger events: 1. the date of final settlement i.e. closing/settlement of the purchase and 2. the date when the buyer/owner first occupies the home. - the warranty coverage starts on the earlier of those two dates whichever comes first. 5 13 this coverage start rule applies to the various coverages under the builders limited warranty including: - the oneyear coverage for structural components plumbing heating electrical systems and roof. 1 10 - the 60day coverage for doors windows switches receptacles fixtures caulking and cabinet work. 1 3 13 all of these coverages begin on that same commencement date defined above. 5 13  2. what must happen before coverage ends the warranty describes several conditions and events that determine when coverage ends or when claims are no longer covered.  a. timebased termination of coverage the warranty sets fixed durations from the commencement date: - except as otherwise provided herein the terms of this limited warranty terminate one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable after commencement. 5 6 - it further states: any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered. 5 6 thus for coverage to apply: - the relevant warranty period must not yet have expired: - 1year period for the items listed in 1.a. 1 10 - 60day period for the items listed in 1.b. 1 3 - a written claim must be made within that 1year or 60day period or the claim is not covered even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. 5 6 8 the notification section reinforces this: - the buyer/owner must prior to the termination of the one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable write a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested 4 6 so coverage effectively ends for a particular defect if: 1. the applicable time period 1 year or 60 days from commencement has passed or 2. the buyer/owner fails to submit a written claim within that period. 5 6 8  b. automatic termination upon sale or moveout the warranty also ends based on certain ownership/occupancy events: - this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. 7 16 - in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates. 7 16 therefore coverage ends immediately if: - the original buyer/owner sells the home or - the original buyer/owner moves out of the home even if the 1year or 60day time period has not yet expired. 7 16  c. exclusions and failure to notify while exclusions do not change the formal term they function as conditions that can prevent coverage from applying: - any and all claims not made in writing before the end of the applicable 1year or 60day period are excluded: any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable. 8 - failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages. 9 14 these provisions mean that even within the time period coverage will not apply if: - the claim is not made in writing within the applicable period. 5 6 8 - in an emergency the buyer/owner fails to promptly notify the builder which cuts off the builders liability for that emergencyrelated damage. 9 14  key connections - the start of coverage is tied to a single commencement date: the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. 5 13 this commencement date is the reference point from which all warranty periods 1 year or 60 days are measured. 1 3 5 - the end of coverage is determined by: - the expiration of the applicable period 1 year or 60 days measured from that commencement date. 5 6 - the requirement that written claims be made before that expiration otherwise the claims are not covered. 5 6 8 - automatic termination if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out regardless of remaining time. 7 16 - notification rules written notice and emergency notice operate as conditions precedent to coverage: even if within the time period failure to comply can eliminate coverage for that defect or damage. 4 6 8 9 14 together the definition of coverage start and these endofcoverage triggers describe a closed window of protection: it opens at the earlier of settlement or occupancy and closes upon the earlier of a time expiration b sale/moveout or c failure to meet notice requirements for a given claim.  conclusion under this builders limited warranty coverage starts on the earlier of 1 the date of final settlement or 2 the date the buyer/owner first occupies the home this is the commencement date for all warranty coverages. 5 13 coverage ends when the applicable warranty period 1 year or 60 days from commencement expires and no timely written claim has been made 5 6 8 or earlier if the original buyer/owner sells the home or moves out which automatically terminates the warranty. 7 16 additionally failure to follow required notice proceduresespecially written notice within the period and prompt notice of emergenciescan cut off coverage or the builders liability for particular defects or damages. 4 6 8 9 14",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. How “coverage start” is defined\n\nThe warranty explicitly defines when coverage begins in the “Term” section:\n\n- “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on **the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first**.” [5], [13]\n\nThis means:\n\n- There are two possible trigger events:\n  1. The **date of final settlement** (i.e., closing/settlement of the purchase), and  \n  2. The **date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**.  \n- The warranty coverage **starts on the earlier of those two dates** (“whichever comes first”). [5], [13]\n\nThis “coverage start” rule applies to “the various coverages” under the Builder’s Limited Warranty, including:\n- The **one‑year** coverage for structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical systems, and roof. [1], [10]\n- The **60‑day** coverage for doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, and cabinet work. [1], [3], [13]\n\nAll of these coverages “begin” on that same commencement date defined above. [5], [13]\n\n### 2. What must happen before coverage ends\n\nThe warranty describes several conditions and events that determine when coverage ends or when claims are no longer covered.\n\n#### a. Time‑based termination of coverage\n\nThe warranty sets fixed durations from the commencement date:\n\n- “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate **one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**.” [5], [6]  \n- It further states: “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [5], [6]\n\nThus, for coverage to apply:\n\n- The relevant warranty period must **not yet have expired**:\n  - 1‑year period for the items listed in §1.A. [1], [10]\n  - 60‑day period for the items listed in §1.B. [1], [3]\n- A **written claim** must be made **within that 1‑year or 60‑day period**, or the claim is “not covered,” even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. [5], [6], [8]\n\nThe notification section reinforces this:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner “must, **prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable, write a letter describing the defect** to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested…” [4], [6]\n\nSo, coverage effectively ends for a particular defect if:\n\n1. The applicable time period (1 year or 60 days from commencement) has passed, **or**  \n2. The Buyer/Owner fails to submit a written claim within that period. [5], [6], [8]\n\n#### b. Automatic termination upon sale or move‑out\n\nThe warranty also ends based on certain ownership/occupancy events:\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is **not transferable**.” [7], [16]  \n- “In the event the first purchaser **sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates**.” [7], [16]\n\nTherefore, coverage ends immediately if:\n\n- The original Buyer/Owner **sells the home**, or  \n- The original Buyer/Owner **moves out of the home**,  \n\neven if the 1‑year or 60‑day time period has not yet expired. [7], [16]\n\n#### c. Exclusions and failure to notify\n\nWhile exclusions do not change the formal “term,” they function as conditions that can prevent coverage from applying:\n\n- Any and all claims **not made in writing** before the end of the applicable 1‑year or 60‑day period are excluded: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.” [8]\n- Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency “**relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages**.” [9], [14]\n\nThese provisions mean that, even within the time period, coverage will not apply if:\n\n- The claim is not made in writing within the applicable period. [5], [6], [8]  \n- In an emergency, the Buyer/Owner fails to promptly notify the Builder, which cuts off the Builder’s liability for that emergency‑related damage. [9], [14]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **start of coverage** is tied to a single “commencement” date: the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [5], [13] This commencement date is the reference point from which all warranty periods (1 year or 60 days) are measured. [1], [3], [5]\n- The **end of coverage** is determined by:\n  - The **expiration of the applicable period** (1 year or 60 days) measured from that commencement date. [5], [6]\n  - The requirement that **written claims** be made before that expiration; otherwise, the claims are “not covered.” [5], [6], [8]\n  - **Automatic termination** if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, regardless of remaining time. [7], [16]\n- Notification rules (written notice and emergency notice) operate as **conditions precedent** to coverage: even if within the time period, failure to comply can eliminate coverage for that defect or damage. [4], [6], [8], [9], [14]\n\nTogether, the definition of “coverage start” and these end‑of‑coverage triggers describe a closed window of protection: it opens at the earlier of settlement or occupancy and closes upon the earlier of (a) time expiration, (b) sale/move‑out, or (c) failure to meet notice requirements for a given claim.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder this Builders Limited Warranty, coverage **starts** on the earlier of (1) the date of final settlement or (2) the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home; this is the “commencement” date for all warranty coverages.

Thus, the total contract price is **$29,900.00**.\n\n### 2. Invoice total amount\n\nThe invoice from Contoso Lifts LLC to Fabrikam Construction lists line items that sum to a subtotal of **$29,900.00** [5], [6], [12]–[17]. The summary section shows:\n\n- SUBTOTAL: 29,900.00  \n- TAX: N/A  \n- TOTAL: 29,900.00  \n- AMOUNT DUE: 29,900.00 [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19].\n\nTherefore, the invoice total amount (and amount due) is **$29,900.00**.\n\n### 3. Do the totals match?\n\nThe purchase contract total price is **$29,900.00** [4], [10], [21].  \nThe invoice total amount is **$29,900.00** [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19].\n\nThese amounts are numerically identical, and there is no evidence of any adjustment, tax, or discount applied on the invoice that would change the total from the contract amount. Both documents also cover the same scope of work (vertical platform lift and associated components) [4], [5], [6], [10], [12]–[17], confirming they refer to the same transaction.\n\nThus, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total amount **match exactly**.\n\n### 4. Matching total amount (if they match)\n\nSince they do match, the common total amount is **$29,900.00** as stated in both the contract [4], [10], [21] and the invoice [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19].\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The contract’s “Total contract price” of $29,900.00 [4], [10], [21] is mirrored by the invoice’s subtotal, total, and amount due of $29,900.00 [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19].\n- The line items on the invoice correspond to the equipment and configuration described in the contract’s scope of work (vertical platform lift, power system, custom cab, outdoor package, aluminum door, hall call stations) [4], [5], [6], [10], [12]–[17], confirming they are for the same project.\n- No additional charges (e.g., tax) are applied on the invoice (tax is “N/A”) [5], [6], [9], [15], so the invoice total remains equal to the contract total.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total match exactly.

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Purchase contract total price and how it is defined\n\nThe purchase contract between Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor) and Fabrikam Inc. (Customer) states:\n\n- “Total contract price is **$29,900.00**, payable in 3 installments:”  \n  - “$20,000.00 upon signing”  \n  - “$7,000.00 upon delivery”  \n  - “$2,900.00 upon completion” [4], [21]\n\nThus, the contract defines the total price as a fixed lump sum of **$29,900.00**, with no tax line or add-ons in the contract text, and specifies only how that total is split into three milestone payments. [4], [21]\n\n### 2. Invoice total amount and how it is calculated\n\nThe invoice from Contoso Lifts LLC to Fabrikam Construction lists itemized components:\n\n- Vertical Platform Lift: $11,200.00 [5], [6], [16]  \n- Operation parts: $3,000.00 [5], [6], [12], [14], [16]  \n- Special Size 42\" x 62\" cab: $5,800.00 [5], [6], [14], [16], [17]  \n- Outdoor fitting: $2,000.00 [5], [6], [13], [14], [17]  \n- Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts and operator: $5,000.00 [5], [6], [13], [15], [17]  \n- Hall Call stations (2 × $1,450.00): $2,900.00 [5], [6], [13], [15], [19]\n\nThese line items sum to a **SUBTOTAL of $29,900.00**. The invoice then shows:\n\n- SUBTOTAL: 29,900.00 [5], [6], [15], [19]  \n- TAX: N/A [5], [6], [15], [19]  \n- TOTAL: 29,900.00 [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19]  \n- AMOUNT DUE: 29,900.00 [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19]\n\nSo the invoice total amount is **$29,900.00**, calculated as the sum of the itemized components, with no tax applied (TAX: N/A). [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19]\n\n### 3. Do the contract total and invoice total match, given their definitions?\n\n- Contract total price: **$29,900.00** as a fixed contract sum, payable in three installments. [4], [21]  \n- Invoice total amount: **$29,900.00** as the sum of itemized goods/services, with TAX: N/A and TOTAL: 29,900.00. [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19]\n\nBoth documents state the same total dollar amount, **$29,900.00**, and neither adds tax or other charges on top of that figure. The invoice is also labeled as “Initial payment in accordance with contract,” indicating it is intended to align with the contract terms. [5]\n\nGiven this, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total amount **match exactly** at $29,900.00. [4], [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19], [21]\n\n### 4. If they match, what is the exact matching amount?\n\nThe exact matching amount, as stated in both the purchase contract and the invoice, is **$29,900.00**. [4], [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19], [21]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The contract defines a single **total contract price** of $29,900.00 and only uses installments to describe timing of payment, not to change the total. [4], [21]\n- The invoice independently itemizes the same project components and arrives at a **subtotal/total** of $29,900.00, with no tax added (TAX: N/A). [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19]\n- Because both documents converge on the same total amount and neither introduces additional charges, the invoice total is consistent with, and equal to, the contract’s total price. [4], [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19], [21]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total match exactly. Both specify a total amount of **$29,900.00**. [4], [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19], [21]",

[4], [21]\n- The invoice independently itemizes the same project components and arrives at a **subtotal/total** of $29,900.00, with no tax added (TAX: N/A). [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19]\n- Because both documents converge on the same total amount and neither introduces additional charges, the invoice total is consistent with, and equal to, the contract’s total price. [4], [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19], [21]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total match exactly. Both specify a total amount of **$29,900.00**. [4], [5], [6], [9], [11], [15], [19], [21]",

Which entity appears in a greater number of different documents?\n\nFrom the counts above:\n\n- `Fabrikam Inc.` → 4 documents[1][2][3][5][8][9][10]  \n- `Contoso Ltd.` → 3 documents[1][2][3][8]\n\nTherefore, **`Fabrikam Inc.` appears in more different documents than `Contoso Ltd.`** across the provided set.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- Both entities co‑appear in three documents:  \n  - Property Management Agreement[1]  \n  - Builders Limited Warranty[2][8]  \n  - Holding Tank Servicing Contract[3]  \n- `Fabrikam Inc.` additionally appears alone (without `Contoso Ltd.`) in the Purchase Contract as the Customer[5][9][10].  \n- `Contoso Ltd.` has no additional documents beyond those three shared ones; the other “Contoso” references are to `Contoso Lifts LLC`, a different entity[5][6][9][10].\n\nThis extra appearance of `Fabrikam Inc.` in the Purchase Contract is what makes its document count higher.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- `Fabrikam Inc.` appears in **4** different documents[1][2][3][5][8][9][10].  \n- `Contoso Ltd.` appears in **3** different documents[1][2][3][8].  \n\nAcross the set, **`Fabrikam Inc.` appears in the most different documents.**",

In how many different documents does `Fabrikam Inc.` appear?\n\nScanning the provided documents:\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**: `Fabrikam Inc.` appears as the party signing as “Principal Broker” for the Agent, Walt Flood Realty. [1]  \n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: `Fabrikam Inc.` appears multiple times as the Builder and in the representative block. [2][8]  \n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: `Fabrikam Inc.` appears as the Pumper. [3]  \n- **doc_f7f98f697dac444e9e7d0af3138bf2d8 (PURCHASE CONTRACT)**: `Fabrikam Inc.` appears as the Customer. [9][10]  \n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: This document references “Fabrikam Construction” and an email at `fabrikam.com`, but not the exact entity string `Fabrikam Inc.`; therefore it does **not** count for `Fabrikam Inc.`. [6][11]\n\nThus, `Fabrikam Inc.` appears in **4 different documents**:  \n1) PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT [1]  \n2) BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY [2][8]  \n3) HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT [3]  \n4) PURCHASE CONTRACT (doc_f7f98f697dac444e9e7d0af3138bf2d8) [9][10]\n\n### 2. In how many different documents does `Contoso Ltd.` appear?\n\nAgain scanning the documents:\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**: `Contoso Ltd.` is the Owner. [1]  \n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: `Contoso Ltd.` is the Buyer/Owner and appears in the signature block. [2][8]  \n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: `Contoso Ltd.` is the Holding Tank Owner. [3]  \n- **doc_f7f98f697dac444e9e7d0af3138bf2d8 (PURCHASE CONTRACT)**: This document involves “Contoso Lifts LLC.”, not `Contoso Ltd.`; different legal entity name, so it does **not** count for `Contoso Ltd.`. [5][9][10]  \n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Again, the entity is “Contoso Lifts LLC”, not `Contoso Ltd.`. [6][7]\n\nThus, `Contoso Ltd.` appears in **3 different documents**:  \n1) PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT [1]  \n2) BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY [2][8]  \n3) HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT [3]\n\n### 3. Which entity appears in the greater number of different documents?\n\nFrom the counts above:\n\n- `Fabrikam Inc.` → 4 documents [1][2][3][9][10]  \n- `Contoso Ltd.` → 3 documents [1][2][3]\n\nTherefore, across the set, **`Fabrikam Inc.` appears in more different documents than `Contoso Ltd.`**.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- Both entities co‑appear in three documents: the PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT [1], the BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY [2][8], and the HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT [3].  \n- `Fabrikam Inc.` has an additional appearance as the Customer in the PURCHASE CONTRACT document [9][10], giving it one more distinct-document occurrence than `Contoso Ltd.`.  \n- Mentions of related but differently named entities (e.g., “Contoso Lifts LLC”, “Fabrikam Construction”) are not counted toward `Contoso Ltd.` or `Fabrikam Inc.` because the entity strings differ and represent distinct legal entities. [5][6][9][10]\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- `Fabrikam Inc.` appears in **4** different documents. [1][2][3][9][10]  \n- `Contoso Ltd.` appears in **3** different documents.

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. In how many different documents does `Fabrikam Inc.` appear?\n\nScanning the provided documents:\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**: `Fabrikam Inc.` appears as the party signing as “Principal Broker” for the Agent, Walt Flood Realty. [1]  \n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: `Fabrikam Inc.` appears multiple times as the Builder and in the representative block. [2][8]  \n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: `Fabrikam Inc.` appears as the Pumper. [3]  \n- **doc_f7f98f697dac444e9e7d0af3138bf2d8 (PURCHASE CONTRACT)**: `Fabrikam Inc.` appears as the Customer. [9][10]  \n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: This document references “Fabrikam Construction” and an email at `fabrikam.com`, but not the exact entity string `Fabrikam Inc.`; therefore it does **not** count for `Fabrikam Inc.`. [6][11]\n\nThus, `Fabrikam Inc.` appears in **4 different documents**:  \n1) PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT [1]  \n2) BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY [2][8]  \n3) HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT [3]  \n4) PURCHASE CONTRACT (doc_f7f98f697dac444e9e7d0af3138bf2d8) [9][10]\n\n### 2. In how many different documents does `Contoso Ltd.` appear?\n\nAgain scanning the documents:\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**: `Contoso Ltd.` is the Owner. [1]  \n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: `Contoso Ltd.` is the Buyer/Owner and appears in the signature block. [2][8]  \n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: `Contoso Ltd.` is the Holding Tank Owner. [3]  \n- **doc_f7f98f697dac444e9e7d0af3138bf2d8 (PURCHASE CONTRACT)**: This document involves “Contoso Lifts LLC.”, not `Contoso Ltd.`; different legal entity name, so it does **not** count for `Contoso Ltd.`. [5][9][10]  \n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Again, the entity is “Contoso Lifts LLC”, not `Contoso Ltd.`. [6][7]\n\nThus, `Contoso Ltd.` appears in **3 different documents**:  \n1) PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT [1]  \n2) BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY [2][8]  \n3) HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT [3]\n\n### 3. Which entity appears in the greater number of different documents?\n\nFrom the counts above:\n\n- `Fabrikam Inc.` → 4 documents [1][2][3][9][10]  \n- `Contoso Ltd.` → 3 documents [1][2][3]\n\nTherefore, across the set, **`Fabrikam Inc.` appears in more different documents than `Contoso Ltd.`**.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- Both entities co‑appear in three documents: the PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT [1], the BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY [2][8], and the HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT [3].  \n- `Fabrikam Inc.` has an additional appearance as the Customer in the PURCHASE CONTRACT document [9][10], giving it one more distinct-document occurrence than `Contoso Ltd.`.  \n- Mentions of related but differently named entities (e.g., “Contoso Lifts LLC”, “Fabrikam Construction”) are not counted toward `Contoso Ltd.` or `Fabrikam Inc.` because the entity strings differ and represent distinct legal entities. [5][6][9][10]\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- `Fabrikam Inc.` appears in **4** different documents. [1][2][3][9][10]  \n- `Contoso Ltd.` appears in **3** different documents. [1][2][3]  \n\nAcross the set, **`Fabrikam Inc.` appears in the greater number of different documents**.",

In how many different documents does `Fabrikam Inc.` appear?\n\nWe look for distinct documents (not repeated mentions within the same document):\n\n1. **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n   - `Fabrikam Inc.` appears as a signing party:  \n     “By: **Fabrikam Inc.** … It’s Principal Broker” in the signature block of the agreement between Contoso Ltd. and Walt Flood Realty.[1]\n\n2. **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**  \n   - `Fabrikam Inc.` is the Builder:  \n     “this Limited Warranty Agreement is extended by **Fabrikam Inc.** (the Builder)”[2][8]  \n   - It also appears in the representative contact information: “Company **Fabrikam Inc.**”[2]  \n   - It signs as Builder in the execution block: “**Fabrikam Inc.** … Builder … Authorized Representative”[2]\n\n3. **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**  \n   - `Fabrikam Inc.` is the Pumper:  \n     “Pumper's Name: **Fabrikam Inc.**”[3]  \n   - Also in the signature table: “Pumper's Name (Print) **Fabrikam Inc.**”[3]\n\n4. **PURCHASE CONTRACT (doc_f7f98f697dac444e9e7d0af3138bf2d8)**  \n   - `Fabrikam Inc.` is the Customer:  \n     “between Contoso Lifts LLC. (Contractor)… and **Fabrikam Inc.

Doc with a percentage-based “fees” concept and its structure\n\nThe **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** explicitly defines multiple fees as percentages of amounts such as gross revenues and repair costs:\n\n- “A fee/commission of **twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues** for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).” [5], [22]  \n- “A fee/commission of **ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues** for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).” [5], [22]  \n- “A fee of **ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations**.” [5], [10], [22]  \n- Additionally, the Agent will charge “the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at **4.712%**) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.” [5], [11], [17], [22]\n\nThese provisions show a clear **percentage-based fee structure**: the agent’s compensation and certain charges are calculated as a percentage of underlying amounts (gross revenues, repair costs, and then tax as a percentage of those fees).  \n\nNo other document in the provided set defines fees in this way. The **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** mentions that the owner “agrees to pay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon” but does **not** specify any percentage or formula for those charges. [1]\n\n### 2. Doc with fixed installment payments and their details\n\nThe **PURCHASE CONTRACT** sets out a “Total contract price” and then breaks it into fixed dollar installments:\n\n- “Total contract price is **$29,900.00, payable in 3 installments**:” [2], [8], [12]  \n  - “**$20,000.00 upon signing**” [2], [8], [12]  \n  - “**$7,000.00 upon delivery**” [2], [8], [12]  \n  - “**$2,900.00 upon completion**” [2], [8], [12]\n\nThese are **fixed installment payments**: specific dollar amounts tied to milestones (signing, delivery, completion), not percentages of some variable base.\n\nThe **contoso_lifts_invoice** shows a single total amount due ($29,900.00) for an invoice, not a multi-installment structure; it lists line-item prices and a subtotal/total, but no percentage-based fee or installment schedule. [3], [4] The **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** likewise does not define fixed installments; it only refers generally to “charges incurred” as agreed. [1]\n\nThus, the **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that clearly uses a **fixed installment payment** structure.\n\n### 3. Overall characterization of each doc’s “fees” concept\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:  \n  The core compensation model is built around **percentage-based fees**:\n  - 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rentals [5], [22]  \n  - 10% of gross revenues for long-term leases [5], [22]  \n  - 10% of total repair/upgrade/renovation charges [5], [10], [22]  \n  - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all those fees [5], [11], [17], [22]  \n\n  While there are some fixed dollar amounts (e.g., $75/month advertising, $50/month admin, $250 start-up fee) [5], [10], [11], [13], [16], the **primary “fees” concept** is percentage-based commissions and charges tied to revenue and costs. Therefore, this document is best characterized as having a **percentage-based fee structure**.\n\n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n  The payment terms are defined entirely as **fixed dollar installments** against a fixed total price:\n  - Total price $29,900.00 [2], [8], [12]  \n  - Three fixed installments: $20,000, $7,000, $2,900 at specified milestones [2], [8], [12]  \n\n  There is no mention of any fee or payment calculated as a percentage of revenue, cost, or any other base. The “fees” concept here is simply the breakdown of a fixed contract price into fixed installments. Thus, this document is best characterized as having **fixed installment payments**.\n\nThe **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** and **contoso_lifts_invoice** do not provide enough structure to characterize them as either percentage-based or fixed-installment “fee” systems in the same sense:  \n- Holding tank contract: payment is “charges incurred … as mutually agreed upon” with no percentages or installment schedule. [1]  \n- Invoice: a one-time total amount due, not a fee structure or installment plan. [3], [4]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **percentage-based structure** appears only in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**, where multiple fees and commissions are explicitly defined as percentages of gross revenues and repair costs, plus a percentage tax on those fees. [5], [10], [11], [17], [22]\n- The **fixed installment structure** appears in the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**, where the total price is split into three fixed dollar payments tied to project milestones. [2], [8], [12]\n- Both documents describe how money is paid over time, but:\n  - The property management document ties payments to **variable economic outcomes** (rents, repair costs), using percentages.\n  - The purchase contract ties payments to **fixed milestones** with **fixed amounts**, independent of revenue or cost fluctuations.\n\nThese contrasting structures directly answer the original comparison: one document’s “fees” are percentage-based; the other’s are fixed installments.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the document that has a **percentage-based fee structure**, with fees such as 25% and 10% of gross revenues and 10% of repair costs, plus a 4.712% tax on those fees.

Property Management Agreement – fee concepts and structures\n\nThis document contains an explicit “AGENT’S FEES” section listing multiple fee types. They fall into two structural categories: percentage‑based and fixed (or fixed‑rate) charges.\n\n**Percentage‑based fees**\n\n1. **Management commission – short‑term rentals**  \n   - “A fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).”[8][9][11][22]  \n   - Structure: clearly a **percentage of gross revenues** (25%).\n\n2. **Management commission – long‑term leases**  \n   - “A fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).”[8][9][11][16][22]  \n   - Structure: **percentage of gross revenues** (10%).\n\n3. **Fee on repairs/upgrades/renovations**  \n   - “A fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.”[8][12][15]  \n   - Structure: **percentage of the total charge** (10%).\n\n4. **Hawaii Gross Excise Tax on all fees**  \n   - “Plus, the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.”[8][13][19]  \n   - Structure: **percentage (4.712%) applied to all the above fees/charges**.\n\n**Fixed or fixed‑rate fees**\n\n5. **Advertising charge**  \n   - “A pro-ration charge for advertising for short-term (vacation rentals), at $75.00/month.”[8][9][15][16]  \n   - Structure: **fixed dollar amount per month** ($75/month).\n\n6. **Administration and accounting charge**  \n   - “A minimum charge for administration and accounting, at $50.00/month (not to include tax preparation/returns/forms).”[8][12][15][16]  \n   - Structure: **fixed dollar amount per month** ($50/month).\n\n7. **Hourly charge for scheduling/escorting repairs, etc.**  \n   - “A charge of $35/hour to schedule repairs, upgrades, renovations, replacement of appliances, carpets, curtains, drapes, and/or to escort the contractors, repair persons, technicians and handymen.”[8][12][19]  \n   - Structure: **fixed hourly rate** ($35/hour).\n\n8. **Non‑refundable agency start‑up fee**  \n   - “Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Owner shall pay two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the Agent as a non-refundable start-up fee.”[8][13][18][19]  \n   - Structure: **one‑time fixed amount** ($250).\n\n9. **Credit card/bankcard fees**  \n   - “Agent is allowed by Owner to accept credit cards and to deduct for credit card and/or bankcard fees from the Owner's proceeds.”[8][11][17][22]  \n   - Structure: the document acknowledges such fees but does not specify whether they are percentage‑based or fixed; in context, they are pass‑through charges deducted from proceeds.\n\nOverall, the Property Management Agreement uses **multiple percentage‑based fees (commissions, repair fee, tax)** plus several fixed or fixed‑rate charges (monthly, hourly, one‑time).\n\n---\n\n#### B. Purchase Contract – fee/payment concepts and structures\n\nThe Purchase Contract does not use the word “fee” for the main economic terms, but it clearly defines a **payment structure**.\n\n**Installment payment structure**\n\n- “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$20,000.00 upon signing”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$7,000.00 upon delivery”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$2,900.00 upon completion”[4][10][14]  \n\nStructure:  \n- A **fixed total price** of $29,900.00, broken into **three fixed installment payments** tied to milestones (signing, delivery, completion).[4][10][14]  \n- No percentages of cost or revenue are mentioned; all amounts are fixed dollar figures.\n\nOther clauses (e.g., “Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone.”[4][10][14][21]) may adjust which installment is affected, but they do not introduce percentage‑based fees.\n\nThere are references to legal fees in default (“Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.”[4][21][23]), but these are contingent litigation costs, not a defined fee structure like a commission or scheduled service fee.\n\nThus, the Purchase Contract’s economic structure is **fixed installment payments**, not percentage‑based fees.\n\n---\n\n#### C. Builders Limited Warranty – fee concepts\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty focuses on warranty coverage, exclusions, and arbitration. It does not define a schedule of “fees” or a payment structure comparable to the other documents.\n\n- It discusses warranty terms, exclusions, and arbitration costs (e.g., “Each party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration and their respective costs including attorneys' fees in any arbitration.”[7]) but this is about **sharing arbitration costs**, not a recurring fee structure for services.\n- There is no percentage‑of‑price or percentage‑of‑revenue fee, and no fixed installment payment plan for a contract price.\n\nSo, for the purpose of comparing “fee structures,” this document does **not** present a defined fee schedule like the Property Management Agreement or a fixed installment payment plan like the Purchase Contract.\n\n---\n\n#### D. Holding Tank Servicing Contract – fee concepts\n\nThe Holding Tank Servicing Contract mentions payment obligations but does not specify the structure:\n\n- “The owner further agrees to pay the pumper for a charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.”[3]  \n\nThis indicates that fees will be paid, but the **amounts and structure (percentage vs fixed vs installments) are not defined** in the text. There is no explicit percentage‑based fee and no fixed installment schedule.\n\nFor the original comparison (percentage‑based vs fixed installment payments), this document does not provide enough detail to characterize its fee structure in those terms.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Overall characterization of each doc’s fee structure and supporting evidence\n\nGiven the above, the two documents that clearly define structured economic terms are:\n\n- **Property Management Agreement** – multiple explicit fees, many of which are percentage‑based.\n- **Purchase Contract** – a clearly defined fixed installment payment plan.\n\n#### Property Management Agreement – overall characterization\n\nThis agreement is best characterized as having a **percentage‑based fee structure**, supplemented by some fixed charges.\n\nKey textual evidence:\n\n- Management commissions as a percentage of gross revenues:  \n  - “twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals”[8][9][11][22]  \n  - “ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases”[8][9][11][16][22]\n- Percentage fee on repair/upgrade/renovation charges:  \n  - “A fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.”[8][12][15]\n- Percentage tax applied to all fees:  \n  - “Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.”[8][13][19]\n\nThese percentage‑based items are central to how the Agent is compensated and how additional costs are calculated, so the document’s fee structure is fundamentally **percentage‑driven**, even though it also includes fixed monthly, hourly, and one‑time charges ($75/month advertising, $50/month admin, $35/hour scheduling, $250 start‑up).[8][12][13][15][18][19]\n\n#### Purchase Contract – overall characterization\n\nThe Purchase Contract is best characterized as having **fixed installment payments** for a fixed total price.\n\nKey textual evidence:\n\n- “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$20,000.00 upon signing”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$7,000.00 upon delivery”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$2,900.00 upon completion”[4][10][14]\n\nThere is no mention of any percentage‑based fee or commission; all amounts are fixed dollar values tied to specific milestones.

            "text_norm": " analysis  1. fees concepts in each relevant document and how they are structured  a. property management agreement  fee concepts and structures this document contains an explicit agents fees section listing multiple fee types. they fall into two structural categories: percentagebased and fixed or fixedrate charges. percentagebased fees 1. management commission  shortterm rentals - a fee/commission of twenty five percent 25% of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals reservations of less than 180 days.891122 - structure: clearly a percentage of gross revenues 25%. 2. management commission  longterm leases - a fee/commission of ten percent 10% of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases leases of more than 180 days.89111622 - structure: percentage of gross revenues 10%. 3. fee on repairs/upgrades/renovations - a fee of ten percent 10% on the total charge for repairs upgrades and/or renovations.81215 - structure: percentage of the total charge 10%. 4. hawaii gross excise tax on all fees - plus the agent will assess/charge the owner the hawaii gross excise tax currently at 4.712% on all the above fees commissions and charges.81319 - structure: percentage 4.712% applied to all the above fees/charges. fixed or fixedrate fees 5. advertising charge - a pro-ration charge for advertising for short-term vacation rentals at $75.00/month.891516 - structure: fixed dollar amount per month $75/month. 6. administration and accounting charge - a minimum charge for administration and accounting at $50.00/month not to include tax preparation/returns/forms.8121516 - structure: fixed dollar amount per month $50/month. 7. hourly charge for scheduling/escorting repairs etc. - a charge of $35/hour to schedule repairs upgrades renovations replacement of appliances carpets curtains drapes and/or to escort the contractors repair persons technicians and handymen.81219 - structure: fixed hourly rate $35/hour. 8. nonrefundable agency startup fee - upon the execution of this agreement the owner shall pay two hundred fifty dollars $250.00 to the agent as a non-refundable start-up fee.8131819 - structure: onetime fixed amount $250. 9. credit card/bankcard fees - agent is allowed by owner to accept credit cards and to deduct for credit card and/or bankcard fees from the owners proceeds.8111722 - structure: the document acknowledges such fees but does not specify whether they are percentagebased or fixed in context they are passthrough charges deducted from proceeds. overall the property management agreement uses multiple percentagebased fees commissions repair fee tax plus several fixed or fixedrate charges monthly hourly onetime. ---  b. purchase contract  fee/payment concepts and structures the purchase contract does not use the word fee for the main economic terms but it clearly defines a payment structure. installment payment structure - total contract price is $29900.00 payable in 3 installments:41014 - $20000.00 upon signing41014 - $7000.00 upon delivery41014 - $2900.00 upon completion41014 structure: - a fixed total price of $29900.00 broken into three fixed installment payments tied to milestones signing delivery completion.41014 - no percentages of cost or revenue are mentioned all amounts are fixed dollar figures. other clauses e.g. any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone.4101421 may adjust which installment is affected but they do not introduce percentagebased fees. there are references to legal fees in default legal fees are recoverable by contractor.42123 but these are contingent litigation costs not a defined fee structure like a commission or scheduled service fee. thus the purchase contracts economic structure is fixed installment payments not percentagebased fees. ---  c. builders limited warranty  fee concepts the builders limited warranty focuses on warranty coverage exclusions and arbitration. it does not define a schedule of fees or a payment structure comparable to the other documents. - it discusses warranty terms exclusions and arbitration costs e.g. each party shall be responsible to pay for one-half 1/2 of the cost and fees of the arbitration and their respective costs including attorneys fees in any arbitration.7 but this is about sharing arbitration costs not a recurring fee structure for services. - there is no percentageofprice or percentageofrevenue fee and no fixed installment payment plan for a contract price. so for the purpose of comparing fee structures this document does not present a defined fee schedule like the property management agreement or a fixed installment payment plan like the purchase contract. ---  d. holding tank servicing contract  fee concepts the holding tank servicing contract mentions payment obligations but does not specify the structure: - the owner further agrees to pay the pumper for a charges incurred in servicing the holding tanks as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.3 this indicates that fees will be paid but the amounts and structure percentage vs fixed vs installments are not defined in the text. there is no explicit percentagebased fee and no fixed installment schedule. for the original comparison percentagebased vs fixed installment payments this document does not provide enough detail to characterize its fee structure in those terms. ---  2. overall characterization of each docs fee structure and supporting evidence given the above the two documents that clearly define structured economic terms are: - property management agreement  multiple explicit fees many of which are percentagebased. - purchase contract  a clearly defined fixed installment payment plan.  property management agreement  overall characterization this agreement is best characterized as having a percentagebased fee structure supplemented by some fixed charges. key textual evidence: - management commissions as a percentage of gross revenues: - twenty five percent 25% of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals891122 - ten percent 10% of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases89111622 - percentage fee on repair/upgrade/renovation charges: - a fee of ten percent 10% on the total charge for repairs upgrades and/or renovations.81215 - percentage tax applied to all fees: - hawaii gross excise tax currently at 4.712% on all the above fees commissions and charges.81319 these percentagebased items are central to how the agent is compensated and how additional costs are calculated so the documents fee structure is fundamentally percentagedriven even though it also includes fixed monthly hourly and onetime charges $75/month advertising $50/month admin $35/hour scheduling $250 startup.81213151819  purchase contract  overall characterization the purchase contract is best characterized as having fixed installment payments for a fixed total price. key textual evidence: - total contract price is $29900.00 payable in 3 installments:41014 - $20000.00 upon signing41014 - $7000.00 upon delivery41014 - $2900.00 upon completion41014 there is no mention of any percentagebased fee or commission all amounts are fixed dollar values tied to specific milestones. the clause on changes any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone.4101421 confirms that the structure is milestonebased installments not a percentage of cost or revenue. thus this documents economic arrangement is clearly fixed installment payments not percentagebased fees. ---  key connections 1. nature of compensation vs. nature of payment: - in the property management agreement the agents compensation is primarily a percentage of economic activity gross rental revenues and repair charges plus some fixed charges.8911121315161922 - in the purchase contract the contractors compensation is a fixed total price split into three fixed installments at defined milestones.41014 2. how fees are calculated: - property management agreement: fees scale with the underlying amounts gross revenues repair costs because they are expressed as percentages 25% 10% 10% 4.712%.8911121315161922 - purchase contract: payments do not scale with any variable they are fixed dollar amounts regardless of actual costs or revenues.41014 3. relevance of other documents: - the builders limited warranty and holding tank servicing contract mention obligations and costs but do not define a structured fee schedule that is clearly percentagebased or fixedinstallmentbased.237 - therefore for the original comparison the meaningful contrast is between the property management agreement percentagebased fees and the purchase contract fixed installment payments.  conclusion - the property management agreement is the document that has a percentagebased fee structure with key fees defined as percentages of gross revenues and of repair/upgrade charges and a percentage tax applied to all such fees.8911121315161922 - the purchase contract is the document that has fixed installment payments with a fixed total contract price of $29900.00 payable in three specified installments of $20000.00 $7000.00 and $2900.00 tied to signing delivery and completion.41014 thus in direct response to the original query: - percentagebased fee structure: property management agreement. - fixed installment payments: purchase contract.",

Property Management Agreement – fee concepts and structures\n\nThis document contains an explicit “AGENT’S FEES” section listing multiple fee types. They fall into two structural categories: percentage‑based and fixed (or fixed‑rate) charges.\n\n**Percentage‑based fees**\n\n1. **Management commission – short‑term rentals**  \n   - “A fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).”[8][9][11][22]  \n   - Structure: clearly a **percentage of gross revenues** (25%).\n\n2. **Management commission – long‑term leases**  \n   - “A fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).”[8][9][11][16][22]  \n   - Structure: **percentage of gross revenues** (10%).\n\n3. **Fee on repairs/upgrades/renovations**  \n   - “A fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.”[8][12][15]  \n   - Structure: **percentage of the total charge** (10%).\n\n4. **Hawaii Gross Excise Tax on all fees**  \n   - “Plus, the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.”[8][13][19]  \n   - Structure: **percentage (4.712%) applied to all the above fees/charges**.\n\n**Fixed or fixed‑rate fees**\n\n5. **Advertising charge**  \n   - “A pro-ration charge for advertising for short-term (vacation rentals), at $75.00/month.”[8][9][15][16]  \n   - Structure: **fixed dollar amount per month** ($75/month).\n\n6. **Administration and accounting charge**  \n   - “A minimum charge for administration and accounting, at $50.00/month (not to include tax preparation/returns/forms).”[8][12][15][16]  \n   - Structure: **fixed dollar amount per month** ($50/month).\n\n7. **Hourly charge for scheduling/escorting repairs, etc.**  \n   - “A charge of $35/hour to schedule repairs, upgrades, renovations, replacement of appliances, carpets, curtains, drapes, and/or to escort the contractors, repair persons, technicians and handymen.”[8][12][19]  \n   - Structure: **fixed hourly rate** ($35/hour).\n\n8. **Non‑refundable agency start‑up fee**  \n   - “Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Owner shall pay two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the Agent as a non-refundable start-up fee.”[8][13][18][19]  \n   - Structure: **one‑time fixed amount** ($250).\n\n9. **Credit card/bankcard fees**  \n   - “Agent is allowed by Owner to accept credit cards and to deduct for credit card and/or bankcard fees from the Owner's proceeds.”[8][11][17][22]  \n   - Structure: the document acknowledges such fees but does not specify whether they are percentage‑based or fixed; in context, they are pass‑through charges deducted from proceeds.\n\nOverall, the Property Management Agreement uses **multiple percentage‑based fees (commissions, repair fee, tax)** plus several fixed or fixed‑rate charges (monthly, hourly, one‑time).\n\n---\n\n#### B. Purchase Contract – fee/payment concepts and structures\n\nThe Purchase Contract does not use the word “fee” for the main economic terms, but it clearly defines a **payment structure**.\n\n**Installment payment structure**\n\n- “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$20,000.00 upon signing”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$7,000.00 upon delivery”[4][10][14]  \n  - “$2,900.00 upon completion”[4][10][14]  \n\nStructure:  \n- A **fixed total price** of $29,900.00, broken into **three fixed installment payments** tied to milestones (signing, delivery, completion).[4][10][14]  \n- No percentages of cost or revenue are mentioned; all amounts are fixed dollar figures.\n\nOther clauses (e.g., “Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone.”[4][10][14][21]) may adjust which installment is affected, but they do not introduce percentage‑based fees.\n\nThere are references to legal fees in default (“Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.”[4][21][23]), but these are contingent litigation costs, not a defined fee structure like a commission or scheduled service fee.\n\nThus, the Purchase Contract’s economic structure is **fixed installment payments**, not percentage‑based fees.\n\n---\n\n#### C. Builders Limited Warranty – fee concepts\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty focuses on warranty coverage, exclusions, and arbitration. It does not define a schedule of “fees” or a payment structure comparable to the other documents.\n\n- It discusses warranty terms, exclusions, and arbitration costs (e.g., “Each party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration and their respective costs including attorneys' fees in any arbitration.”[7]) but this is about **sharing arbitration costs**, not a recurring fee structure for services.\n- There is no percentage‑of‑price or percentage‑of‑revenue fee, and no fixed installment payment plan for a contract price.\n\nSo, for the purpose of comparing “fee structures,” this document does **not** present a defined fee schedule like the Property Management Agreement or a fixed installment payment plan like the Purchase Contract.\n\n---\n\n#### D. Holding Tank Servicing Contract – fee concepts\n\nThe Holding Tank Servicing Contract mentions payment obligations but does not specify the structure:\n\n- “The owner further agrees to pay the pumper for a charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.”[3]  \n\nThis indicates that fees will be paid, but the **amounts and structure (percentage vs fixed vs installments) are not defined** in the text. There is no explicit percentage‑based fee and no fixed installment schedule.\n\nFor the original comparison (percentage‑based vs fixed installment payments), this document does not provide enough detail to characterize its fee structure in those terms.\n\n---\n\n### 2.

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Doc with a percentage-based “fees” concept and supporting language\n\nThe **Property Management Agreement** clearly describes a “fees” concept that is calculated as a percentage of amounts such as gross revenues and repair costs.\n\nKey percentage-based language:\n\n- “A fee/commission of **twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues** for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals…” [1][6][9][11][22]  \n- “A fee/commission of **ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues** for management services for long term leases…” [1][6][9][11][16][22]  \n- “A fee of **ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations**.” [1][6][12][15]  \n- “Plus, the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at **4.712%**) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.” [1][6][13][19]\n\nThese provisions show that the agent’s compensation and certain taxes are calculated as a **percentage of underlying amounts** (gross revenues, total repair charges, and fee bases), which is a classic percentage-based fee structure.\n\n### 2. Doc with fixed installment payments and supporting language\n\nThe **Purchase Contract** describes a payment structure that is explicitly broken into fixed dollar installments.\n\nKey fixed-installment language:\n\n- “Total contract price is **$29,900.00, payable in 3 installments**:” [4][10][14]  \n- “**$20,000.00 upon signing**” [4][10][14]  \n- “**$7,000.00 upon delivery**” [4][10][14]  \n- “**$2,900.00 upon completion**” [4][10][14]\n\nThese are **fixed, predetermined dollar amounts** tied to milestones (signing, delivery, completion), not percentages of a variable base. That indicates a **fixed installment payment structure**.\n\n### 3. Classification and comparison of fee structures between the docs\n\n- **Property Management Agreement**  \n  - Classified as: **Percentage-based fee structure**  \n  - Basis:\n    - Management fees are a percentage of “gross revenues” (25% for short-term/vacation rentals; 10% for long-term leases) [1][6][9][11][16][22].  \n    - Additional fees (e.g., 10% on total repair/upgrade charges) are also percentage-based [1][6][12][15].  \n    - Even the excise tax is expressed as a percentage (4.712%) applied to the fees and commissions [1][6][13][19].  \n  - While there are some fixed monthly charges (e.g., $75/month advertising, $50/month administration) [1][6][9][12][15][16], the core “fees” concept for management services is percentage-based.\n\n- **Purchase Contract**  \n  - Classified as: **Fixed installment payment structure**  \n  - Basis:\n    - The total price is a fixed sum ($29,900.00) divided into three fixed installments: $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900, each due at specific milestones [4][10][14].  \n    - There is no language tying these payments to a percentage of revenue, costs, or any other variable base; they are fixed amounts.\n\n- **Other documents (for completeness)**  \n  - **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**: Refers only to “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon” without specifying percentage-based or fixed-installment structure [3].  \n  - **Builder’s Limited Warranty**: Discusses warranty terms and arbitration, not a fee/payment structure like the others [2][5].\n\nThus, for the purpose of comparing “fees” concepts, the relevant contrast is between the **Property Management Agreement** (percentage-based fees) and the **Purchase Contract** (fixed installments).\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The original query asks: “Compare the ‘fees’ concepts: which doc has a percentage-based fee structure and which has fixed installment payments?”\n\n- Sub-question 1 identified the **Property Management Agreement** as the document with explicit percentage-based fees, supported by repeated “X percent (%) of the gross revenues” and “X percent (%) on the total charge” language [1][6][9][11][12][13][15][16][19][22].\n\n- Sub-question 2 identified the **Purchase Contract** as the document with fixed installment payments, supported by the “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments: $20,000.00 upon signing; $7,000.00 upon delivery; $2,900.00 upon completion” language [4][10][14].\n\n- Sub-question 3 then classifies and compares:\n  - Property Management Agreement → **percentage-based fee structure** (fees scale with revenues and repair costs) [1][6][9][11][12][13][15][16][19][22].  \n  - Purchase Contract → **fixed installment payment structure** (fixed dollar amounts at defined milestones) [4][10][14].\n\nTogether, these show that the two documents embody **different economic models** for “fees”: one variable and revenue-based, the other fixed and milestone-based.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The **Property Management Agreement** has a **percentage-based fee structure**, with key fees defined as percentages of gross revenues and total repair charges, and taxes expressed as a percentage of those fees [1][6][9][11][12][13][15][16][19][22].\n\n- The **Purchase Contract** uses **fixed installment payments**, with the total price of $29,900.00 divided into three fixed-dollar installments due at signing, delivery, and completion [4][10][14].\n\nSo, in direct response to the original query:  \n- **Percentage-based fees** → Property Management Agreement.  \n- **Fixed installment payments** → Purchase Contract.",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. “Risk of loss” statements across the set\n\nOnly the **Purchase Contract** contains an explicit “risk of loss” allocation:\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Section 5 (Risk of Loss)**  \n  > “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]  \n\nThis clause clearly allocates the risk of loss for the lift and related equipment: the Contractor bears the risk up to the point of delivery, and the Customer bears it after delivery. This is the only direct “risk of loss” provision in the provided documents.\n\nThe other documents do not use the phrase “risk of loss,” but they do allocate responsibility for certain losses:\n\n- **Property Management Agreement – Insurance obligation**  \n  The Owner must:  \n  > “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured…” [13]  \n\n  This shifts financial risk for bodily injury and property damage to the Owner’s insurance, but it is framed as an insurance requirement rather than a classic “risk of loss” clause.\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty – Exclusions and damage allocation**  \n  The Builder excludes responsibility for various categories of damage, including:  \n  > “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.” [4]/[14]  \n  > “Loss or damage caused by insects or animals, fire, explosion, smoke, water escape, change or movement of ground water or soils, glass breakage, wind storm, hail, lightening, falling trees, aircraft, vehicles, flood, earthquakes or acts of God.” [2]/[4]/[14]  \n  > “M. Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.” [2]/[19]/[22]  \n\n  These exclusions function as risk allocation by placing the risk of those losses on the Buyer/Owner rather than the Builder, but again they are not labeled “risk of loss.”\n\n**Direct “risk of loss” statement:**  \n- “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]\n\n---\n\n### 2. “Liability limitations” statements across the set\n\nEach of the main agreements contains provisions that limit or allocate liability.\n\n#### a. Property Management Agreement\n\n- **Hold Harmless / Limitation of Agent’s Liability**  \n  > “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.” [1]/[8]/[16]  \n\n  This clause:\n  - Disclaims Agent’s liability for most claims for loss or injury on the property (except gross negligence or willful misconduct). [1]/[8]/[16]  \n  - Requires the Owner to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless for such claims. [1]/[8]/[16]  \n\n  It is a classic liability limitation and indemnity provision.\n\n- **Insurance requirement as a related risk allocation**  \n  > “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured…” [13]  \n\n  This supports the liability limitation by ensuring insurance coverage for the risks the Owner is bearing.\n\n#### b. Builders Limited Warranty\n\nThe Builder’s warranty document contains multiple liability-limiting provisions:\n\n- **Exclusion of consequential/incidental damages**  \n  > “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. (SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU).” [2]/[4]/[14]  \n\n- **Broad exclusions from coverage**  \n  > “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.” [14]  \n\n  Followed by specific exclusions, including:  \n  - Defects or damage covered by manufacturers’ warranties. [2]/[21]  \n  - Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, or lack of maintenance. [2]/[21]  \n  - Loss or damage caused by insects, animals, fire, water escape, acts of God, etc. [2]/[4]/[14]  \n  - Defects in items not part of the original home. [2]/[19]/[22]  \n  - “M. Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.” [2]/[19]/[22]  \n\n  These provisions limit the Builder’s liability to a narrow set of covered defects and exclude many categories of loss.\n\n- **Disclaimer of all other warranties**  \n  > “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH INCLUDE (BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO COVER THE PRESENCE OF RADON OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.” [15]/[22]  \n\n  This limits the Buyer/Owner’s remedies to those expressly provided in the limited warranty.\n\n- **Time-bar on claims**  \n  > “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [2]/[17]  \n\n  This functions as a liability limitation by cutting off claims after the specified period.\n\n#### c. Purchase Contract\n\nThe Purchase Contract has a narrower but still clear liability allocation:\n\n- **Risk of loss allocation** (also a liability allocation)  \n  > “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]  \n\n  This determines who bears loss if the goods are damaged at different stages.\n\n- **Legal fees on customer default**  \n  > “Failure to pay may result in legal action. Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.” [4]/[10]  \n\n  While not a limitation of Contractor’s liability, it shifts litigation cost risk to the Customer in the event of default.\n\n#### d. Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\nThe Holding Tank Servicing Contract does not contain explicit limitation-of-liability language. It mainly addresses obligations and reporting. [3] There is no express “not liable for X” or “limit of liability is Y” clause in the excerpt.\n\n**Key liability limitation statements:**\n\n- “Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property… except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.” [1]/[8]/[16]  \n- “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.” [14]  \n- “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES…” are excluded. [2]/[4]/[14]  \n- “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES… ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.” [15]/[22]  \n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING… ARE NOT COVERED.” [2]/[17]  \n- “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]  \n\n---\n\n### 3. “Non-transferability” statements across the set\n\nOnly the **Builders Limited Warranty** contains an explicit non-transferability clause:\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty – Not Transferable**  \n  > “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [2]/[8]/[9]  \n\nThis provision:\n- Restricts the benefit of the warranty to the original Buyer/Owner. [2]/[8]/[9]  \n- Terminates the warranty automatically upon sale or move-out. [2]/[8]/[9]  \n\nThis is a clear non-transferability risk allocation: subsequent owners bear the risk of defects without the benefit of this warranty.\n\nThe other documents do not use “non-transferable” language, but there are related concepts:\n\n- **Property Management Agreement – Binding on successors and assigns**  \n  > “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.” [1]/[8]  \n\n  This is the opposite of non-transferability: it expressly allows the agreement to bind successors and assigns, rather than cutting off rights.\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Assignment restriction**  \n  > “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.” [4]/[11]  \n\n  This is an **assignment restriction**, not a full non-transferability of rights. It controls transfer of the contract but does not say that rights automatically terminate on transfer; instead, assignment requires consent.\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract – Change/termination**  \n  The contract can be terminated or changed, and changes must be filed with the municipality and County:  \n  > “This agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract. In the event of a change in this contract, the owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the County…” [3]  \n\n  This governs continuation and modification, but does not expressly state that the contract is non-transferable.\n\n**Direct non-transferability statement:**\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [2]/[8]/[9]  \n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n1. **Risk of loss vs. liability limitations**  \n   - The **Purchase Contract** explicitly allocates risk of loss between Contractor and Customer at the delivery point: “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]  \n   - The **Property Management Agreement** and **Builders Limited Warranty** allocate risk more indirectly through liability limitations and exclusions:\n     - The Agent is largely insulated from liability for loss or injury on the property, with the Owner indemnifying the Agent. [1]/[8]/[16]  \n     - The Builder excludes many categories of damage and disclaims other warranties, leaving the Buyer/Owner to bear those risks. [2]/[4]/[14]/[15]/[19]/[22]  \n\n   All three documents, in different ways, determine who bears financial responsibility for various losses.\n\n2. **Liability limitations and non-transferability as complementary risk allocation tools**  \n   - The **Builders Limited Warranty** uses both:\n     - Liability limitations (exclusions, disclaimers, time limits). [2]/[4]/[14]/[15]/[17]/[19]/[22]  \n     - Non-transferability (warranty only for first purchaser; terminates on sale or move-out). [2]/[8]/[9]  \n   - Together, these provisions tightly confine the Builder’s exposure: only certain defects, within a limited time, for a single owner.\n\n3. **Transferability controls vs. non-transferability**  \n   - The **Builders Limited Warranty** is explicitly “not transferable” and terminates on transfer. [2]/[8]/[9]  \n   - The **Purchase Contract** restricts assignment (“Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.” [4]/[11]) but does not automatically terminate on transfer; it just requires consent.  \n   - The **Property Management Agreement** goes the other way, making the agreement “binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.” [1]/[8]  \n\n   These different approaches show how transferability itself is used as a risk allocation mechanism: limiting who can benefit from or be bound by obligations.\n\n4. **Insurance and indemnity reinforcing liability limitations**  \n   - In the **Property Management Agreement**, the Owner’s obligation to carry liability insurance and name the Agent as an additional insured [13] supports the hold-harmless clause that protects the Agent from most claims. [1]/[8]/[16]  \n   - In the **Builders Limited Warranty**, the exclusion of many types of damage [2]/[4]/[14]/[19]/[22] and the disclaimer of other warranties [15]/[22] ensure that the Builder’s liability is narrow and predictable.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the set, the three types of “risk allocation” statements are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**  \n   - **Purchase Contract**:  \n     > “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]  \n\n2. **Liability limitations**  \n   - **Property Management Agreement**:  \n     > “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.” [1]/[8]/[16]  \n   - **Builders Limited Warranty** (representative statements):  \n     > “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.” [14]  \n     > “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES…” are excluded. [2]/[4]/[14]  \n     > “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES… ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.” [15]/[22]  \n     > “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING… ARE NOT COVERED.” [2]/[17]  \n\n3. **Non-transferability**  \n   - **Builders Limited Warranty**:  \n     > “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [2]/[8]/[9]  \n\nTogether, these provisions show how the documents allocate risk by:  \n- Defining who bears loss at different times (risk of loss) [4];  \n- Limiting or excluding liability and remedies (liability limitations) [1]/[8]/[14]/[15]/[17]/[19]/[22]; and  \n- Controlling who can benefit from or be bound by rights and obligations (non-transferability and assignment/transfer rules) [2]/[8]/[9]/[4]/[11]/[1]/[8].",

insurance requirement as a related risk allocation  provide liability insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300000 for bodily injury and $25000 for property damage to others. the agent shall be named as additional insured 13 this supports the liability limitation by ensuring insurance coverage for the risks the owner is bearing.  b. builders limited warranty the builders warranty document contains multiple liability-limiting provisions: - exclusion of consequential/incidental damages  consequential or incidental damages. some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so the limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. 2/4/14 - broad exclusions from coverage  the builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. 14 followed by specific exclusions including: - defects or damage covered by manufacturers warranties. 2/21 - damage from ordinary wear and tear abuse neglect or lack of maintenance. 2/21 - loss or damage caused by insects animals fire water escape acts of god etc. 2/4/14 - defects in items not part of the original home. 2/19/22 - m. bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by builder. 2/19/22 these provisions limit the builders liability to a narrow set of covered defects and exclude many categories of loss. - disclaimer of all other warranties  this expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by builder. all other warranties including implied warranties which include but is not limited to warranties of merchantability fitness for a particular purpose habitability and good workmanship and any warranty that might be construed to cover the presence of radon or other environmental pollutants are hereby disclaimed. 15/22 this limits the buyer/owners remedies to those expressly provided in the limited warranty. - time-bar on claims  any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered. 2/17 this functions as a liability limitation by cutting off claims after the specified period.  c. purchase contract the purchase contract has a narrower but still clear liability allocation: - risk of loss allocation also a liability allocation  contractor holds risk until delivery. customer holds risk thereafter. 4 this determines who bears loss if the goods are damaged at different stages. - legal fees on customer default  failure to pay may result in legal action. legal fees are recoverable by contractor. 4/10 while not a limitation of contractors liability it shifts litigation cost risk to the customer in the event of default.  d. holding tank servicing contract the holding tank servicing contract does not contain explicit limitation-of-liability language. it mainly addresses obligations and reporting. 3 there is no express not liable for x or limit of liability is y clause in the excerpt. key liability limitation statements: - agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property except for loss or injury caused by agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct and owner shall hold agent harmless and indemnify agent for any such claim or liability. 1/8/16 - the builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. 14 - consequential or incidental damages are excluded. 2/4/14 - this expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by builder. all other warranties are hereby disclaimed. 15/22 - any claims which have not been made in writing are not covered. 2/17 - contractor holds risk until delivery. customer holds risk thereafter. 4 ---  3. non-transferability statements across the set only the builders limited warranty contains an explicit non-transferability clause: - builders limited warranty  not transferable  this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates. 2/8/9 this provision: - restricts the benefit of the warranty to the original buyer/owner. 2/8/9 - terminates the warranty automatically upon sale or move-out. 2/8/9 this is a clear non-transferability risk allocation: subsequent owners bear the risk of defects without the benefit of this warranty. the other documents do not use non-transferable language but there are related concepts: - property management agreement  binding on successors and assigns  this agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of owner or agent. 1/8 this is the opposite of non-transferability: it expressly allows the agreement to bind successors and assigns rather than cutting off rights. - purchase contract  assignment restriction  neither party may assign this contract without the others written consent. 4/11 this is an assignment restriction not a full non-transferability of rights. it controls transfer of the contract but does not say that rights automatically terminate on transfer instead assignment requires consent. - holding tank servicing contract  change/termination the contract can be terminated or changed and changes must be filed with the municipality and county:  this agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract. in the event of a change in this contract the owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the county 3 this governs continuation and modification but does not expressly state that the contract is non-transferable. direct non-transferability statement: - this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates. 2/8/9 ---  key connections 1. risk of loss vs. liability limitations - the purchase contract explicitly allocates risk of loss between contractor and customer at the delivery point: contractor holds risk until delivery. customer holds risk thereafter. 4 - the property management agreement and builders limited warranty allocate risk more indirectly through liability limitations and exclusions: - the agent is largely insulated from liability for loss or injury on the property with the owner indemnifying the agent. 1/8/16 - the builder excludes many categories of damage and disclaims other warranties leaving the buyer/owner to bear those risks. 2/4/14/15/19/22 all three documents in different ways determine who bears financial responsibility for various losses. 2. liability limitations and non-transferability as complementary risk allocation tools - the builders limited warranty uses both: - liability limitations exclusions disclaimers time limits. 2/4/14/15/17/19/22 - non-transferability warranty only for first purchaser terminates on sale or move-out. 2/8/9 - together these provisions tightly confine the builders exposure: only certain defects within a limited time for a single owner. 3. transferability controls vs. non-transferability - the builders limited warranty is explicitly not transferable and terminates on transfer. 2/8/9 - the purchase contract restricts assignment neither party may assign this contract without the others written consent. 4/11 but does not automatically terminate on transfer it just requires consent. - the property management agreement goes the other way making the agreement binding upon the successors and assigns of owner or agent. 1/8 these different approaches show how transferability itself is used as a risk allocation mechanism: limiting who can benefit from or be bound by obligations. 4. insurance and indemnity reinforcing liability limitations - in the property management agreement the owners obligation to carry liability insurance and name the agent as an additional insured 13 supports the hold-harmless clause that protects the agent from most claims. 1/8/16 - in the builders limited warranty the exclusion of many types of damage 2/4/14/19/22 and the disclaimer of other warranties 15/22 ensure that the builders liability is narrow and predictable. ---  conclusion across the set the three types of risk allocation statements are: 1. risk of loss - purchase contract:  contractor holds risk until delivery. customer holds risk thereafter. 4 2. liability limitations - property management agreement:  the owner agrees that agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement except for loss or injury caused by agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct and owner shall hold agent harmless and indemnify agent for any such claim or liability. 1/8/16 - builders limited warranty representative statements:  the builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. 14  consequential or incidental damages are excluded. 2/4/14  this expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by builder. all other warranties are hereby disclaimed. 15/22  any claims which have not been made in writing are not covered. 2/17 3. non-transferability - builders limited warranty:  this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates. 2/8/9 together these provisions show how the documents allocate risk by: - defining who bears loss at different times risk of loss 4 - limiting or excluding liability and remedies liability limitations 1/8/14/15/17/19/22 and - controlling who can benefit from or be bound by rights and obligations non-transferability and assignment/transfer rules 2/8/9/4/11/1/8.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. “Risk of loss” statements across the set\n\nOnly the **Purchase Contract** contains an explicit “risk of loss” allocation:\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Section 5 (Risk of Loss)**  \n  > “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]  \n\nThis clause clearly allocates the risk of loss for the lift and related equipment: the Contractor bears the risk up to the point of delivery, and the Customer bears it after delivery. This is the only direct “risk of loss” provision in the provided documents.\n\nThe other documents do not use the phrase “risk of loss,” but they do allocate responsibility for certain losses:\n\n- **Property Management Agreement – Insurance obligation**  \n  The Owner must:  \n  > “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured…” [13]  \n\n  This shifts financial risk for bodily injury and property damage to the Owner’s insurance, but it is framed as an insurance requirement rather than a classic “risk of loss” clause.\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty – Exclusions and damage allocation**  \n  The Builder excludes responsibility for various categories of damage, including:  \n  > “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.” [4]/[14]  \n  > “Loss or damage caused by insects or animals, fire, explosion, smoke, water escape, change or movement of ground water or soils, glass breakage, wind storm, hail, lightening, falling trees, aircraft, vehicles, flood, earthquakes or acts of God.” [2]/[4]/[14]  \n  > “M. Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.” [2]/[19]/[22]  \n\n  These exclusions function as risk allocation by placing the risk of those losses on the Buyer/Owner rather than the Builder, but again they are not labeled “risk of loss.”\n\n**Direct “risk of loss” statement:**  \n- “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]\n\n---\n\n### 2. “Liability limitations” statements across the set\n\nEach of the main agreements contains provisions that limit or allocate liability.\n\n#### a. Property Management Agreement\n\n- **Hold Harmless / Limitation of Agent’s Liability**  \n  > “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.” [1]/[8]/[16]  \n\n  This clause:\n  - Disclaims Agent’s liability for most claims for loss or injury on the property (except gross negligence or willful misconduct). [1]/[8]/[16]  \n  - Requires the Owner to indemnify and hold the Agent harmless for such claims. [1]/[8]/[16]  \n\n  It is a classic liability limitation and indemnity provision.\n\n- **Insurance requirement as a related risk allocation**  \n  > “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured…” [13]  \n\n  This supports the liability limitation by ensuring insurance coverage for the risks the Owner is bearing.\n\n#### b. Builders Limited Warranty\n\nThe Builder’s warranty document contains multiple liability-limiting provisions:\n\n- **Exclusion of consequential/incidental damages**  \n  > “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. (SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU).” [2]/[4]/[14]  \n\n- **Broad exclusions from coverage**  \n  > “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.” [14]  \n\n  Followed by specific exclusions, including:  \n  - Defects or damage covered by manufacturers’ warranties. [2]/[21]  \n  - Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, or lack of maintenance. [2]/[21]  \n  - Loss or damage caused by insects, animals, fire, water escape, acts of God, etc. [2]/[4]/[14]  \n  - Defects in items not part of the original home. [2]/[19]/[22]  \n  - “M. Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.” [2]/[19]/[22]  \n\n  These provisions limit the Builder’s liability to a narrow set of covered defects and exclude many categories of loss.\n\n- **Disclaimer of all other warranties**  \n  > “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH INCLUDE (BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO COVER THE PRESENCE OF RADON OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.” [15]/[22]  \n\n  This limits the Buyer/Owner’s remedies to those expressly provided in the limited warranty.\n\n- **Time-bar on claims**  \n  > “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [2]/[17]  \n\n  This functions as a liability limitation by cutting off claims after the specified period.\n\n#### c. Purchase Contract\n\nThe Purchase Contract has a narrower but still clear liability allocation:\n\n- **Risk of loss allocation** (also a liability allocation)  \n  > “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]  \n\n  This determines who bears loss if the goods are damaged at different stages.\n\n- **Legal fees on customer default**  \n  > “Failure to pay may result in legal action. Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.” [4]/[10]  \n\n  While not a limitation of Contractor’s liability, it shifts litigation cost risk to the Customer in the event of default.\n\n#### d. Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\nThe Holding Tank Servicing Contract does not contain explicit limitation-of-liability language. It mainly addresses obligations and reporting. [3] There is no express “not liable for X” or “limit of liability is Y” clause in the excerpt.\n\n**Key liability limitation statements:**\n\n- “Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property… except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.” [1]/[8]/[16]  \n- “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.” [14]  \n- “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES…” are excluded. [2]/[4]/[14]  \n- “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES… ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.” [15]/[22]  \n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING… ARE NOT COVERED.” [2]/[17]  \n- “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” [4]  \n\n---\n\n### 3. “Non-transferability” statements across the set\n\nOnly the **Builders Limited Warranty** contains an explicit non-transferability clause:\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty – Not Transferable**  \n  > “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [2]/[8]/[9]  \n\nThis provision:\n- Restricts the benefit of the warranty to the original Buyer/Owner. [2]/[8]/[9]  \n- Terminates the warranty automatically upon sale or move-out. [2]/[8]/[9]  \n\nThis is a clear non-transferability risk allocation: subsequent owners bear the risk of defects without the benefit of this warranty.\n\nThe other documents do not use “non-transferable” language, but there are related concepts:\n\n- **Property Management Agreement – Binding on successors and assigns**  \n  > “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.” [1]/[8]  \n\n  This is the opposite of non-transferability: it expressly allows the agreement to bind successors and assigns, rather than cutting off rights.\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Assignment restriction**  \n  > “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.” [4]/[11]  \n\n  This is an **assignment restriction**, not a full non-transferability of rights. It controls transfer of the contract but does not say that rights automatically terminate on transfer; instead, assignment requires consent.\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract – Change/termination**  \n  The contract can be terminated or changed, and changes must be filed with the municipality and County:  \n  > “This agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract. In the event of a change in this contract, the owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the County…” [3]  \n\n  This governs continuation and modification, but does not expressly state that the contract is non-transferable.\n\n**Direct non-transferability statement:**\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [2]/[8]/[9]  \n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n1. **Risk of loss vs. liability limitations**  \n   - The **Purchase Contract** explicitly allocates risk of loss between Contractor and Customer at the delivery point: “Contractor holds risk until delivery.

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Risk allocation – **risk of loss**\n\nAcross the three documents, “risk of loss” is addressed indirectly, by specifying who bears responsibility for certain losses or must insure against them.\n\n**a. Property Management Agreement**\n\n- The Owner must “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured…”[13].  \n  - This allocates the risk of bodily injury and property damage claims arising from the property primarily to the Owner (who must procure insurance), while extending coverage to the Agent as an additional insured.[13]\n- The Owner agrees that the Agent “shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property… except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[8][16]  \n  - This shifts the risk of loss for most injuries and property damage on the premises to the Owner, except where the Agent is grossly negligent or engages in willful misconduct.[8][16]\n\n**b. Builder’s Limited Warranty**\n\n- The warranty excludes “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES” from coverage.[4][14]  \n  - This allocates the risk of consequential or incidental losses (e.g., lost use, secondary damage) to the Buyer/Owner rather than the Builder.[4][14]\n- It excludes “Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.”[2][22]  \n  - This places the risk of such bodily injury and non-covered property damage on the Buyer/Owner or others, not on the Builder.[22]\n- It excludes “Loss or damage caused by insects or animals, fire, explosion, smoke, water escape, change or movement of ground water or soils, glass breakage, wind storm, hail, lightening, falling trees, aircraft, vehicles, flood, earthquakes or acts of God.”[2][4][14]  \n  - This allocates the risk of these external or “act of God” losses to the Buyer/Owner, outside the Builder’s warranty responsibility.[2][4][14]\n- It excludes defects or damage caused by “ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, or lack of due care or proper maintenance” and by “negligence, improper maintenance, lack of maintenance, improper action or inaction, willful or malicious acts by any party other than the Builder, its employees, agents or subcontractors.”[2][19][21]  \n  - This allocates the risk of loss arising from the Buyer/Owner’s or third parties’ conduct to the Buyer/Owner, not the Builder.[19][21]\n\n**c. Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n\n- The Owner “agrees to maintain the all-weather access road or drive so that the pumper can service the holding tank(s) with the pumping equipment” and “agrees to pay the pumper for all charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s).”[3]  \n  - While not using “risk of loss” language, this allocates operational risk (e.g., inability to service due to access issues, and the cost of service) to the Owner.[3]\n- The Pumper’s obligations are limited to reporting and servicing; there is no assumption of broader loss risks (e.g., environmental damage, property damage) in the text provided, implying those risks remain with the Owner unless otherwise governed by law.[3]\n\n**Summary for risk of loss:**  \n- Property Management Agreement: Owner bears risk of most on-premises loss/injury, must insure, and indemnify Agent except for Agent’s gross negligence/willful misconduct.[8][13][16]  \n- Builder’s Limited Warranty: Buyer/Owner bears risk of consequential damages, many external perils, bodily injury, and damage outside the original home, and damage caused by their own or third-party acts/omissions.[2][4][14][19][21][22]  \n- Holding Tank Contract: Owner bears risk and cost of ensuring access and paying for service; Pumper’s risk is limited to performing and reporting service.[3]\n\n---\n\n### 2. Risk allocation – **liability limitations**\n\nHere, the focus is on clauses that limit a party’s liability or disclaim warranties.\n\n**a. Property Management Agreement**\n\n- “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property… except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[8][16]  \n  - This is a liability limitation and indemnity clause:  \n    - Agent’s liability is excluded for virtually all claims except those arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct.[8][16]  \n    - Owner must indemnify and hold Agent harmless for such claims, effectively shifting liability exposure to the Owner (and their insurance).[8][16]\n- The Owner also acknowledges that the Agent “has made no guarantees (written or verbal) of occupancy or income levels for the property.”[8][16]  \n  - This disclaims liability for failure to achieve any particular occupancy or income, limiting Agent’s exposure for economic expectations.[8][16]\n\n**b. Builder’s Limited Warranty**\n\n- Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages: “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. A. CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.”[2][4][14]  \n  - This limits the Builder’s liability by excluding consequential and incidental damages from warranty coverage.[4][14]\n- Broad exclusions for many categories of damage (wear and tear, acts of God, third-party negligence, etc.)[2][4][14][19][21][22]  \n  - These exclusions limit the Builder’s liability to a narrow set of defects in materials or workmanship within the specified periods.[2][4][14][19][21][22]\n- Strong disclaimer of other warranties: “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES… OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP… ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[15][22]  \n  - This limits liability by eliminating implied warranties and restricting the Buyer/Owner to the express limited warranty terms.[15][22]\n- Time limitation: “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.”[2][17]  \n  - This is a temporal limitation on liability: if the Buyer/Owner does not submit a written claim within the warranty period, the Builder has no liability under the warranty.[17]\n- Notification and emergency reporting requirements: failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency “relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[6]  \n  - This further limits the Builder’s liability if the Buyer/Owner does not follow the specified procedures.[6]\n\n**c. Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n\n- The contract as provided does not contain an explicit limitation-of-liability clause or warranty disclaimer. It primarily allocates duties (filing, access, reporting, payment) without expressly limiting either party’s liability for negligence or other claims.[3]  \n  - Thus, compared to the other two documents, it has minimal explicit liability limitation language.\n\n**Summary for liability limitations:**  \n- Property Management Agreement: Agent’s liability is broadly disclaimed except for gross negligence/willful misconduct; Owner must indemnify Agent; no guarantees of occupancy/income.[8][16]  \n- Builder’s Limited Warranty: Builder’s liability is tightly limited by exclusions (including consequential damages), warranty-only coverage, disclaimers of all other warranties, strict claim deadlines, and procedural requirements.[2][4][14][15][17][19][21][22]  \n- Holding Tank Contract: No explicit liability limitation language in the excerpt; risk is allocated mainly through duties, not formal liability caps.[3]\n\n---\n\n### 3. Risk allocation – **non-transferability (restrictions on transfer/assignment)**\n\nThis focuses on clauses that restrict transfer or assignment of rights or obligations.\n\n**a. Property Management Agreement**\n\n- “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[1][8]  \n  - This is the opposite of a non-transferability clause: it expressly allows the agreement to bind successors and assigns, implying that rights/obligations can pass to them.[1][8]  \n  - There is no explicit prohibition on assignment or transfer of the agreement itself in the provided text.\n\n**b. Builder’s Limited Warranty**\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[9]  \n  - This is a clear non-transferability clause:  \n    - Only the first Buyer/Owner can benefit from the warranty.[9]  \n    - If the home is sold or the first purchaser moves out, the warranty ends and cannot be assigned to subsequent owners.[9]\n\n**c. Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n\n- The contract states: “This agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract.

This combination both allocates risk of loss (Owner bears it and insures) and limits the Agent’s liability exposure.  \n   - In the Builder’s Limited Warranty, exclusions for many categories of damage and for consequential/incidentals[2][4][14][19][21][22] are both risk-of-loss allocations (Buyer/Owner bears those risks) and liability limitations (Builder is not responsible for them). The strict time and notice requirements further limit the Builder’s liability window.[2][17][6]\n\n2. **Non-transferability as a risk allocation tool**  \n   - The Builder’s Limited Warranty’s non-transferability clause[9] allocates warranty risk strictly to the first Buyer/Owner: subsequent purchasers bear the risk of defects without the benefit of this warranty.  \n   - By contrast, the Property Management Agreement’s “successors and assigns” language[1][8] spreads the contractual risk and obligations to future owners/agents, rather than cutting them off.  \n   - The Holding Tank Contract’s silence on transfer means any risk allocation in it (e.g., Owner’s duty to maintain access and pay charges[3]) is not expressly tied to a non-transferability rule; changes are handled by new or amended contracts filed with the authorities.[3]\n\n3. **Different instruments, different emphasis**  \n   - The Property Management Agreement emphasizes shifting premises liability and economic expectation risk (occupancy/income) away from the Agent and onto the Owner (backed by insurance).[8][13][16]  \n   - The Builder’s Limited Warranty emphasizes limiting the Builder’s exposure to a narrow, time-bound set of construction defects, excluding many categories of loss and terminating rights upon transfer of the home.[2][4][14][15][17][19][21][22][9]  \n   - The Holding Tank Contract focuses on operational responsibilities and regulatory reporting, with relatively little explicit language on liability caps or transfer.[3]\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnswering the original query—“List the three different ‘risk allocation’ statements across the set (risk of loss, liability limitations, non-transferability)”—the three categories of risk allocation and how they appear across the documents are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Owner must carry liability insurance and name Agent as additional insured[13]; Owner bears risk of most on-premises loss/injury and indemnifies Agent, except for Agent’s gross negligence/willful misconduct.[8][16]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Buyer/Owner bears risk of consequential/incidentals, many external perils, bodily injury, and damage outside the original home, and damage caused by their or third parties’ acts/omissions, all excluded from warranty coverage.[2][4][14][19][21][22]  \n   - Holding Tank Contract: Owner bears operational risk and cost of maintaining access and paying for servicing; Pumper’s role is limited to service and reporting.[3]\n\n2. **Liability limitations**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Agent’s liability is broadly disclaimed except for gross negligence/willful misconduct; Owner must hold Agent harmless and indemnify; no guarantees of occupancy or income.[8][16]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Builder’s liability is limited by exclusions (including consequential damages), exclusive reliance on the express limited warranty, disclaimers of all other warranties, strict claim deadlines, and notice requirements that can relieve the Builder of “all liability” if not followed.[2][4][14][15][17][6][19][21][22]  \n   - Holding Tank Contract: No explicit limitation-of-liability clause in the excerpt; risk is allocated mainly through duties rather than formal liability caps.[3]\n\n3. **Non-transferability**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Agreement is “binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent,” indicating transferability rather than non-transferability.[1][8]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Expressly “not transferable”; warranty terminates automatically if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, confining warranty risk allocation to the original Buyer/Owner.[9]  \n   - Holding Tank Contract: No explicit non-transferability clause; changes or new contracts must be filed with the municipality and County, but assignment/transfer is not directly addressed.[3]\n\nTogether, these three types of statements—allocation of who bears particular losses, explicit limitations on liability, and rules on whether rights/obligations can be transferred—form the core risk allocation framework across the set of documents.",
            "text_norm": " analysis  1. risk allocation  risk of loss across the three documents risk of loss is addressed indirectly by specifying who bears responsibility for certain losses or must insure against them. a. property management agreement - the owner must provide liability insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300000 for bodily injury and $25000 for property damage to others. the agent shall be named as additional insured13. - this allocates the risk of bodily injury and property damage claims arising from the property primarily to the owner who must procure insurance while extending coverage to the agent as an additional insured.13 - the owner agrees that the agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property except for loss or injury caused by agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct and owner shall hold agent harmless and indemnify agent for any such claim or liability.816 - this shifts the risk of loss for most injuries and property damage on the premises to the owner except where the agent is grossly negligent or engages in willful misconduct.816 b. builders limited warranty - the warranty excludes consequential or incidental damages from coverage.414 - this allocates the risk of consequential or incidental losses e.g. lost use secondary damage to the buyer/owner rather than the builder.414 - it excludes bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by builder.222 - this places the risk of such bodily injury and non-covered property damage on the buyer/owner or others not on the builder.22 - it excludes loss or damage caused by insects or animals fire explosion smoke water escape change or movement of ground water or soils glass breakage wind storm hail lightening falling trees aircraft vehicles flood earthquakes or acts of god.2414 - this allocates the risk of these external or act of god losses to the buyer/owner outside the builders warranty responsibility.2414 - it excludes defects or damage caused by ordinary wear and tear abuse neglect or lack of due care or proper maintenance and by negligence improper maintenance lack of maintenance improper action or inaction willful or malicious acts by any party other than the builder its employees agents or subcontractors.21921 - this allocates the risk of loss arising from the buyer/owners or third parties conduct to the buyer/owner not the builder.1921 c. holding tank servicing contract - the owner agrees to maintain the all-weather access road or drive so that the pumper can service the holding tanks with the pumping equipment and agrees to pay the pumper for all charges incurred in servicing the holding tanks.3 - while not using risk of loss language this allocates operational risk e.g. inability to service due to access issues and the cost of service to the owner.3 - the pumpers obligations are limited to reporting and servicing there is no assumption of broader loss risks e.g. environmental damage property damage in the text provided implying those risks remain with the owner unless otherwise governed by law.3 summary for risk of loss: - property management agreement: owner bears risk of most on-premises loss/injury must insure and indemnify agent except for agents gross negligence/willful misconduct.81316 - builders limited warranty: buyer/owner bears risk of consequential damages many external perils bodily injury and damage outside the original home and damage caused by their own or third-party acts/omissions.2414192122 - holding tank contract: owner bears risk and cost of ensuring access and paying for service pumpers risk is limited to performing and reporting service.3 ---  2. risk allocation  liability limitations here the focus is on clauses that limit a partys liability or disclaim warranties. a. property management agreement - the owner agrees that agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property except for loss or injury caused by agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct and owner shall hold agent harmless and indemnify agent for any such claim or liability.816 - this is a liability limitation and indemnity clause: - agents liability is excluded for virtually all claims except those arising from gross negligence or willful misconduct.816 - owner must indemnify and hold agent harmless for such claims effectively shifting liability exposure to the owner and their insurance.816 - the owner also acknowledges that the agent has made no guarantees written or verbal of occupancy or income levels for the property.816 - this disclaims liability for failure to achieve any particular occupancy or income limiting agents exposure for economic expectations.816 b. builders limited warranty - exclusion of consequential or incidental damages: the builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. a. consequential or incidental damages.2414 - this limits the builders liability by excluding consequential and incidental damages from warranty coverage.414 - broad exclusions for many categories of damage wear and tear acts of god third-party negligence etc.2414192122 - these exclusions limit the builders liability to a narrow set of defects in materials or workmanship within the specified periods.2414192122 - strong disclaimer of other warranties: this expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by builder. all other warranties including implied warranties of merchantability fitness for a particular purpose habitability and good workmanship are hereby disclaimed.1522 - this limits liability by eliminating implied warranties and restricting the buyer/owner to the express limited warranty terms.1522 - time limitation: any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered.217 - this is a temporal limitation on liability: if the buyer/owner does not submit a written claim within the warranty period the builder has no liability under the warranty.17 - notification and emergency reporting requirements: failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.6 - this further limits the builders liability if the buyer/owner does not follow the specified procedures.6 c. holding tank servicing contract - the contract as provided does not contain an explicit limitation-of-liability clause or warranty disclaimer. it primarily allocates duties filing access reporting payment without expressly limiting either partys liability for negligence or other claims.3 - thus compared to the other two documents it has minimal explicit liability limitation language. summary for liability limitations: - property management agreement: agents liability is broadly disclaimed except for gross negligence/willful misconduct owner must indemnify agent no guarantees of occupancy/income.816 - builders limited warranty: builders liability is tightly limited by exclusions including consequential damages warranty-only coverage disclaimers of all other warranties strict claim deadlines and procedural requirements.24141517192122 - holding tank contract: no explicit liability limitation language in the excerpt risk is allocated mainly through duties not formal liability caps.3 ---  3. risk allocation  non-transferability restrictions on transfer/assignment this focuses on clauses that restrict transfer or assignment of rights or obligations. a. property management agreement - this agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of owner or agent.18 - this is the opposite of a non-transferability clause: it expressly allows the agreement to bind successors and assigns implying that rights/obligations can pass to them.18 - there is no explicit prohibition on assignment or transfer of the agreement itself in the provided text. b. builders limited warranty - this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates.9 - this is a clear non-transferability clause: - only the first buyer/owner can benefit from the warranty.9 - if the home is sold or the first purchaser moves out the warranty ends and cannot be assigned to subsequent owners.9 c. holding tank servicing contract - the contract states: this agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract. in the event of a change in this contract the owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the county3 - this addresses duration and modification but does not explicitly address assignment or transfer of the contract to another owner or pumper.3 - there is no express non-transferability clause in the excerpt. summary for non-transferability: - property management agreement: explicitly binding on successors and assigns so it is transferable rather than non-transferable.18 - builders limited warranty: expressly not transferable warranty terminates upon sale or move-out by the first purchaser.9 - holding tank contract: silent on transfer/assignment only addresses termination and filing of changes/new contracts.3 ---  key connections 1. risk of loss vs. liability limitations - in the property management agreement the owners obligation to carry liability insurance and to indemnify the agent13816 works together with the limitation of the agents liability to gross negligence/willful misconduct816. this combination both allocates risk of loss owner bears it and insures and limits the agents liability exposure. -

The strict time and notice requirements further limit the Builder’s liability window.[2][17][6]\n\n2. **Non-transferability as a risk allocation tool**  \n   - The Builder’s Limited Warranty’s non-transferability clause[9] allocates warranty risk strictly to the first Buyer/Owner: subsequent purchasers bear the risk of defects without the benefit of this warranty.  \n   - By contrast, the Property Management Agreement’s “successors and assigns” language[1][8] spreads the contractual risk and obligations to future owners/agents, rather than cutting them off.  \n   - The Holding Tank Contract’s silence on transfer means any risk allocation in it (e.g., Owner’s duty to maintain access and pay charges[3]) is not expressly tied to a non-transferability rule; changes are handled by new or amended contracts filed with the authorities.[3]\n\n3. **Different instruments, different emphasis**  \n   - The Property Management Agreement emphasizes shifting premises liability and economic expectation risk (occupancy/income) away from the Agent and onto the Owner (backed by insurance).[8][13][16]  \n   - The Builder’s Limited Warranty emphasizes limiting the Builder’s exposure to a narrow, time-bound set of construction defects, excluding many categories of loss and terminating rights upon transfer of the home.[2][4][14][15][17][19][21][22][9]  \n   - The Holding Tank Contract focuses on operational responsibilities and regulatory reporting, with relatively little explicit language on liability caps or transfer.[3]\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAnswering the original query—“List the three different ‘risk allocation’ statements across the set (risk of loss, liability limitations, non-transferability)”—the three categories of risk allocation and how they appear across the documents are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Owner must carry liability insurance and name Agent as additional insured[13]; Owner bears risk of most on-premises loss/injury and indemnifies Agent, except for Agent’s gross negligence/willful misconduct.[8][16]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Buyer/Owner bears risk of consequential/incidentals, many external perils, bodily injury, and damage outside the original home, and damage caused by their or third parties’ acts/omissions, all excluded from warranty coverage.[2][4][14][19][21][22]  \n   - Holding Tank Contract: Owner bears operational risk and cost of maintaining access and paying for servicing; Pumper’s role is limited to service and reporting.[3]\n\n2. **Liability limitations**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Agent’s liability is broadly disclaimed except for gross negligence/willful misconduct; Owner must hold Agent harmless and indemnify; no guarantees of occupancy or income.[8][16]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Builder’s liability is limited by exclusions (including consequential damages), exclusive reliance on the express limited warranty, disclaimers of all other warranties, strict claim deadlines, and notice requirements that can relieve the Builder of “all liability” if not followed.[2][4][14][15][17][6][19][21][22]  \n   - Holding Tank Contract: No explicit limitation-of-liability clause in the excerpt; risk is allocated mainly through duties rather than formal liability caps.[3]\n\n3. **Non-transferability**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Agreement is “binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent,” indicating transferability rather than non-transferability.[1][8]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Expressly “not transferable”; warranty terminates automatically if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, confining warranty risk allocation to the original Buyer/Owner.[9]  \n   - Holding Tank Contract: No explicit non-transferability clause; changes or new contracts must be filed with the municipality and County, but assignment/transfer is not directly addressed.[3]\n\nTogether, these three types of statements—allocation of who bears particular losses, explicit limitations on liability, and rules on whether rights/obligations can be transferred—form the core risk allocation framework across the set of documents.",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Risk allocation – **risk of loss**\n\nAcross the three documents, “risk of loss” is handled indirectly by specifying who bears responsibility for losses, injuries, or damages, and by requiring insurance.\n\n#### a. Property Management Agreement\n\nRisk of loss is allocated primarily to the Owner, with limited carve‑outs for the Agent:\n\n- **Owner must carry liability insurance and name Agent as additional insured**:  \n  The Owner must “[p]rovide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured and shall be furnished with a copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance.” [13]  \n  This places the financial risk of bodily injury and property damage on the Owner (and the Owner’s insurer), and protects the Agent by making it an additional insured.\n\n- **Hold harmless / indemnity in favor of Agent**:  \n  “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.” [8][16]  \n  This allocates the risk of loss (claims for loss or injury) to the Owner, except where the Agent is grossly negligent or engages in willful misconduct. The Owner must also indemnify the Agent, meaning the Owner ultimately bears the financial burden of such claims (again, typically via the required insurance).\n\nTogether, these provisions allocate the risk of loss on the property to the Owner, with a narrow exception for the Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. [8][13][16]\n\n#### b. Builder’s Limited Warranty\n\nRisk of loss is allocated by defining what the Builder will and will not be responsible for under the warranty:\n\n- **Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages**:  \n  “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. A. CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. (SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU).” [4][14]  \n  This shifts the risk of consequential/indirect losses (e.g., lost use, secondary damage) to the Buyer/Owner.\n\n- **Exclusion of many categories of damage and loss**:  \n  The Builder excludes responsibility for, among other things:  \n  – Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, or lack of proper maintenance. [21]  \n  – Loss or damage caused by insects, animals, fire, explosion, smoke, water escape, ground movement, weather events, flood, earthquakes, or acts of God. [2][4][14][21]  \n  – Bodily injury or damage to personal property or to real property not part of the original home. [19][22]  \n  – Defects or damage covered by manufacturers’ warranties. [21]  \n  – Defects caused or worsened by negligence or improper maintenance by parties other than the Builder. [19][21]  \n  These exclusions allocate the risk of those losses to the Buyer/Owner (or their insurers), not the Builder.\n\n- **Time‑bar on claims**:  \n  “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [17]  \n  If the Buyer/Owner does not timely assert a claim, the risk of any resulting loss remains with the Buyer/Owner.\n\nOverall, the Builder assumes limited risk (repair/replace certain defects within defined periods) and allocates most other loss risks to the Buyer/Owner. [2][4][14][17][19][21][22]\n\n#### c. Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\nThis contract does not explicitly discuss “risk of loss” or liability for damage or injury. It focuses on service obligations and reporting:\n\n- The Owner must allow access and maintain an all‑weather access road so the pumper can service the tank, and must pay charges for servicing. [3]  \n- The Pumper must submit detailed service reports to the County. [3]\n\nThere is no explicit clause allocating liability for spills, property damage, or personal injury, nor any insurance requirement. [3]  \nThus, in this document, risk of loss is not expressly allocated; it would default to applicable law.\n\n### 2. Risk allocation – **liability limitations**\n\nHere we focus on explicit limitations on liability (caps, exclusions, disclaimers).\n\n#### a. Property Management Agreement\n\nThe key liability limitation is the hold‑harmless clause:\n\n- “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.” [8][16]  \n\nThis is a broad limitation of the Agent’s liability:  \n- The Agent is not liable for claims for loss or injury on the property, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. [8][16]  \n- The Owner must indemnify the Agent for such claims, effectively shifting liability back to the Owner (and the Owner’s insurer). [8][13][16]\n\nThere is also a **disclaimer of guarantees**:\n\n- “The Owner understands and agrees that Agent has made no guarantees (written or verbal) of occupancy or income levels for the property.” [8][16]  \n\nThis limits the Agent’s liability for any alleged failure to achieve certain occupancy or income levels.\n\n#### b. Builder’s Limited Warranty\n\nThis document contains extensive liability limitations:\n\n- **Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages**:  \n  “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. A. CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.” [4][14]  \n  This limits the Builder’s liability to direct repair/replace obligations and excludes broader economic or consequential losses.\n\n- **Exclusion of many categories of damage** (as noted above):  \n  The Builder excludes responsibility for damage from wear and tear, neglect, acts of God, non‑residential use, defects in items not installed by Builder, bodily injury, damage to personal property, etc. [2][4][19][21][22]  \n  These exclusions significantly limit the Builder’s liability.\n\n- **Disclaimer of all other warranties**:  \n  “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH INCLUDE (BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO COVER THE PRESENCE OF RADON OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.” [15][22]  \n  This limits liability by eliminating implied warranties that could otherwise expand the Builder’s obligations.\n\n- **Time limitation on claims**:  \n  “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [17]  \n  This is a temporal limitation on liability.\n\n- **Arbitration clause**:  \n  All disputes (with limited small‑claims exceptions) must be resolved by binding arbitration, and once decided, “no Dispute can later be brought, filed or pursued in court except to enforce decision of the arbitrator.” [5][9]  \n  While procedural, this also functions as a liability‑management mechanism by channeling claims into arbitration.\n\nCollectively, these provisions sharply limit the Builder’s liability to a narrow, time‑bound repair/replace obligation. [2][4][5][9][14][15][17][19][21][22]\n\n#### c. Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\nThis contract does not contain explicit liability limitation language:\n\n- No hold‑harmless, indemnity, or limitation of damages clause appears. [3]  \n- No disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of consequential damages is stated. [3]\n\nThus, there is effectively **no express liability limitation** in this document; liability would be governed by general law.\n\n### 3. Risk allocation – **non‑transferability**\n\nHere we identify statements that restrict transferability of rights/obligations.\n\n#### a. Property Management Agreement\n\nThe agreement is expressly **binding on successors and assigns**, not non‑transferable:\n\n- “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.” [1][8]  \n\nThis indicates transferability rather than non‑transferability. There is no clause stating that the agreement or any rights under it are non‑transferable. [1][8]\n\n#### b. Builder’s Limited Warranty\n\nThis document contains a clear non‑transferability clause:\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [8][9]  \n\nThis is a direct **non‑transferability** statement:  \n- Only the first purchaser (Buyer/Owner) can benefit from the warranty. [2][8][9]  \n- If the home is sold or the first purchaser moves out, the warranty ends and cannot be transferred to a subsequent owner. [8][9]\n\nThis allocates the risk of defects arising after a sale or move‑out to subsequent owners (who will not have this warranty), not to the Builder.\n\n#### c. Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\nThe contract is silent on transferability:\n\n- It states that the agreement remains in effect until the owner or pumper terminates it and that changes or a new service contract must be filed with the municipality and County within ten business days. [3]  \n- There is no explicit clause stating that the contract or rights under it are non‑transferable. [3]\n\nThus, there is **no express non‑transferability provision** here; any transferability issues would be governed by general law or by future contract changes.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n1. **Risk of loss vs. liability limitations**  \n   - In the Property Management Agreement, risk of loss on the property is placed on the Owner through insurance requirements and indemnity, while the Agent’s liability is limited to cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. [8][13][16]  \n   - In the Builder’s Limited Warranty, the Builder assumes a narrow risk (repair/replace certain defects) and excludes a wide range of damages and categories of loss, thereby limiting liability and leaving most risk of loss with the Buyer/Owner. [2][4][14][15][17][19][21][22]  \n   - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract does not expressly allocate risk of loss or limit liability, so those issues are left to default law. [3]\n\n2. **Non‑transferability as a risk allocation tool**  \n   - The Builder’s Limited Warranty uses a non‑transferability clause to confine the Builder’s obligations to the first purchaser only; once the home is sold or the first purchaser moves out, the warranty terminates. [8][9] This shifts the risk of later defects to subsequent owners.  \n   - The Property Management Agreement does the opposite: it is expressly binding on successors and assigns, so obligations and benefits can pass to new parties. [1][8]  \n   - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract is silent, so there is no explicit non‑transferability allocation. [3]\n\n3. **Different documents, different risk‑allocation strategies**  \n   - The Property Management Agreement uses **insurance + indemnity + liability limitation** to allocate risk between Owner and Agent. [8][13][16]  \n   - The Builder’s Limited Warranty uses **narrow express warranty + broad exclusions + disclaimer of implied warranties + non‑transferability + arbitration** to tightly control the Builder’s exposure. [2][4][5][8][9][14][15][17][19][21][22]  \n   - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract is primarily operational and regulatory (service and reporting obligations) and does not contain explicit risk‑allocation clauses. [3]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn response to the original query—“List the three different ‘risk allocation’ statements across the set (risk of loss, liability limitations, non‑transferability)”—the synthesized answer is:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Owner bears risk of loss for bodily injury and property damage via required liability insurance naming Agent as additional insured and via indemnity; Agent is only exposed for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. [8][13][16]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Builder assumes limited risk (repair/replace certain defects within defined periods) and excludes many categories of damage and loss, leaving most risk of loss with the Buyer/Owner. [2][4][14][17][19][21][22]  \n   - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: No explicit risk‑of‑loss allocation; risk is left to general law. [3]\n\n2. **Liability limitations**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Agent “shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury” on the property except for gross negligence or willful misconduct, and Owner must hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent; Agent also disclaims any guarantees of occupancy or income. [8][16]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Builder excludes consequential and incidental damages, disclaims all implied warranties, excludes numerous categories of damage (including bodily injury and damage to personal property), and imposes strict time limits on claims, thereby sharply limiting liability. [4][14][15][17][19][21][22]  \n   - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: No express liability limitation provisions. [3]\n\n3. **Non‑transferability**  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [8][9]  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Expressly binding on “successors and assigns of Owner or Agent,” indicating transferability rather than non‑transferability. [1][8]  \n   - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: No explicit non‑transferability clause; changes or new contracts must be filed with the municipality and County, but transferability is not directly addressed. [3]\n\nThese three categories—risk of loss, liability limitations, and non‑transferability—together show how each document structures and allocates legal and financial risk among the parties.",
            "text_norm": " analysis  1. risk allocation  risk of loss across the three documents risk of loss is handled indirectly by specifying who bears responsibility for losses injuries or damages and by requiring insurance.  a. property management agreement risk of loss is allocated primarily to the owner with limited carveouts for the agent: - owner must carry liability insurance and name agent as additional insured: the owner must provide liability insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300000 for bodily injury and $25000 for property damage to others. the agent shall be named as additional insured and shall be furnished with a copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance. 13 this places the financial risk of bodily injury and property damage on the owner and the owners insurer and protects the agent by making it an additional insured. - hold harmless / indemnity in favor of agent: the owner agrees that agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement except for loss or injury caused by agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct and owner shall hold agent harmless and indemnify agent for any such claim or liability. 816 this allocates the risk of loss claims for loss or injury to the owner except where the agent is grossly negligent or engages in willful misconduct. the owner must also indemnify the agent meaning the owner ultimately bears the financial burden of such claims again typically via the required insurance. together these provisions allocate the risk of loss on the property to the owner with a narrow exception for the agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. 81316  b. builders limited warranty risk of loss is allocated by defining what the builder will and will not be responsible for under the warranty: - exclusion of consequential or incidental damages: the builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. a. consequential or incidental damages. some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages so the limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. 414 this shifts the risk of consequential/indirect losses e.g. lost use secondary damage to the buyer/owner. - exclusion of many categories of damage and loss: the builder excludes responsibility for among other things:  damage from ordinary wear and tear abuse neglect or lack of proper maintenance. 21  loss or damage caused by insects animals fire explosion smoke water escape ground movement weather events flood earthquakes or acts of god. 241421  bodily injury or damage to personal property or to real property not part of the original home. 1922  defects or damage covered by manufacturers warranties. 21  defects caused or worsened by negligence or improper maintenance by parties other than the builder. 1921 these exclusions allocate the risk of those losses to the buyer/owner or their insurers not the builder. - timebar on claims: any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered. 17 if the buyer/owner does not timely assert a claim the risk of any resulting loss remains with the buyer/owner. overall the builder assumes limited risk repair/replace certain defects within defined periods and allocates most other loss risks to the buyer/owner. 241417192122  c. holding tank servicing contract this contract does not explicitly discuss risk of loss or liability for damage or injury. it focuses on service obligations and reporting: - the owner must allow access and maintain an allweather access road so the pumper can service the tank and must pay charges for servicing. 3 - the pumper must submit detailed service reports to the county. 3 there is no explicit clause allocating liability for spills property damage or personal injury nor any insurance requirement. 3 thus in this document risk of loss is not expressly allocated it would default to applicable law.  2. risk allocation  liability limitations here we focus on explicit limitations on liability caps exclusions disclaimers.  a. property management agreement the key liability limitation is the holdharmless clause: - the owner agrees that agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement except for loss or injury caused by agents gross negligence or wilful misconduct and owner shall hold agent harmless and indemnify agent for any such claim or liability. 816 this is a broad limitation of the agents liability: - the agent is not liable for claims for loss or injury on the property except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. 816 - the owner must indemnify the agent for such claims effectively shifting liability back to the owner and the owners insurer. 81316 there is also a disclaimer of guarantees: - the owner understands and agrees that agent has made no guarantees written or verbal of occupancy or income levels for the property. 816 this limits the agents liability for any alleged failure to achieve certain occupancy or income levels.  b. builders limited warranty this document contains extensive liability limitations: - exclusion of consequential or incidental damages: the builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. a. consequential or incidental damages. 414 this limits the builders liability to direct repair/replace obligations and excludes broader economic or consequential losses. - exclusion of many categories of damage as noted above: the builder excludes responsibility for damage from wear and tear neglect acts of god nonresidential use defects in items not installed by builder bodily injury damage to personal property etc. 24192122 these exclusions significantly limit the builders liability. - disclaimer of all other warranties: this expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by builder. all other warranties including implied warranties which include but is not limited to warranties of merchantability fitness for a particular purpose habitability and good workmanship and any warranty that might be construed to cover the presence of radon or other environmental pollutants are hereby disclaimed. 1522 this limits liability by eliminating implied warranties that could otherwise expand the builders obligations. - time limitation on claims: any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered. 17 this is a temporal limitation on liability. - arbitration clause: all disputes with limited smallclaims exceptions must be resolved by binding arbitration and once decided no dispute can later be brought filed or pursued in court except to enforce decision of the arbitrator. 59 while procedural this also functions as a liabilitymanagement mechanism by channeling claims into arbitration. collectively these provisions sharply limit the builders liability to a narrow timebound repair/replace obligation. 2459141517192122  c. holding tank servicing contract this contract does not contain explicit liability limitation language: -

The Owner must also indemnify the Agent, meaning the Owner ultimately bears the financial burden of such claims (again, typically via the required insurance).\n\nTogether, these provisions allocate the risk of loss on the property to the Owner, with a narrow exception for the Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. [8][13][16]\n\n#### b. Builder’s Limited Warranty\n\nRisk of loss is allocated by defining what the Builder will and will not be responsible for under the warranty:\n\n- **Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages**:  \n  “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty. A. CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. (SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU).” [4][14]  \n  This shifts the risk of consequential/indirect losses (e.g., lost use, secondary damage) to the Buyer/Owner.\n\n- **Exclusion of many categories of damage and loss**:  \n  The Builder excludes responsibility for, among other things:  \n  – Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, or lack of proper maintenance. [21]  \n  – Loss or damage caused by insects, animals, fire, explosion, smoke, water escape, ground movement, weather events, flood, earthquakes, or acts of God. [2][4][14][21]  \n  – Bodily injury or damage to personal property or to real property not part of the original home. [19][22]  \n  – Defects or damage covered by manufacturers’ warranties. [21]  \n  – Defects caused or worsened by negligence or improper maintenance by parties other than the Builder. [19][21]  \n  These exclusions allocate the risk of those losses to the Buyer/Owner (or their insurers), not the Builder.\n\n- **Time‑bar on claims**:  \n  “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [17]  \n  If the Buyer/Owner does not timely assert a claim, the risk of any resulting loss remains with the Buyer/Owner.\n\nOverall, the Builder assumes limited risk (repair/replace certain defects within defined periods) and allocates most other loss risks to the Buyer/Owner.

Risk allocation – **liability limitations**\n\nHere we focus on explicit limitations on liability (caps, exclusions, disclaimers).\n\n#### a. Property Management Agreement\n\nThe key liability limitation is the hold‑harmless clause:\n\n- “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.” [8][16]  \n\nThis is a broad limitation of the Agent’s liability:  \n- The Agent is not liable for claims for loss or injury on the property, except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. [8][16]  \n- The Owner must indemnify the Agent for such claims, effectively shifting liability back to the Owner (and the Owner’s insurer).

ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH INCLUDE (BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO COVER THE PRESENCE OF RADON OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.” [15][22]  \n  This limits liability by eliminating implied warranties that could otherwise expand the Builder’s obligations.\n\n- **Time limitation on claims**:  \n  “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [17]  \n  This is a temporal limitation on liability.\n\n- **Arbitration clause**:  \n  All disputes (with limited small‑claims exceptions) must be resolved by binding arbitration, and once decided, “no Dispute can later be brought, filed or pursued in court except to enforce decision of the arbitrator.” [5][9]  \n  While procedural, this also functions as a liability‑management mechanism by channeling claims into arbitration.\n\nCollectively, these provisions sharply limit the Builder’s liability to a narrow, time‑bound repair/replace obligation.

[3]  \n- No disclaimer of warranties or exclusion of consequential damages is stated. [3]\n\nThus, there is effectively **no express liability limitation** in this document; liability would be governed by general law.\n\n### 3. Risk allocation – **non‑transferability**\n\nHere we identify statements that restrict transferability of rights/obligations.\n\n#### a. Property Management Agreement\n\nThe agreement is expressly **binding on successors and assigns**, not non‑transferable:\n\n- “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.” [1][8]  \n\nThis indicates transferability rather than non‑transferability. There is no clause stating that the agreement or any rights under it are non‑transferable. [1][8]\n\n#### b. Builder’s Limited Warranty\n\nThis document contains a clear non‑transferability clause:\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [8][9]  \n\nThis is a direct **non‑transferability** statement:  \n- Only the first purchaser (Buyer/Owner) can benefit from the warranty. [2][8][9]  \n- If the home is sold or the first purchaser moves out, the warranty ends and cannot be transferred to a subsequent owner. [8][9]\n\nThis allocates the risk of defects arising after a sale or move‑out to subsequent owners (who will not have this warranty), not to the Builder.\n\n#### c. Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\nThe contract is silent on transferability:\n\n- It states that the agreement remains in effect until the owner or pumper terminates it and that changes or a new service contract must be filed with the municipality and County within ten business days. [3]  \n- There is no explicit clause stating that the contract or rights under it are non‑transferable. [3]\n\nThus, there is **no express non‑transferability provision** here; any transferability issues would be governed by general law or by future contract changes.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n1. **Risk of loss vs. liability limitations**  \n   - In the Property Management Agreement, risk of loss on the property is placed on the Owner through insurance requirements and indemnity, while the Agent’s liability is limited to cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. [8][13][16]  \n   - In the Builder’s Limited Warranty, the Builder assumes a narrow risk (repair/replace certain defects) and excludes a wide range of damages and categories of loss, thereby limiting liability and leaving most risk of loss with the Buyer/Owner. [2][4][14][15][17][19][21][22]  \n   - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract does not expressly allocate risk of loss or limit liability, so those issues are left to default law. [3]\n\n2. **Non‑transferability as a risk allocation tool**  \n   - The Builder’s Limited Warranty uses a non‑transferability clause to confine the Builder’s obligations to the first purchaser only; once the home is sold or the first purchaser moves out, the warranty terminates. [8][9] This shifts the risk of later defects to subsequent owners.  \n   - The Property Management Agreement does the opposite: it is expressly binding on successors and assigns, so obligations and benefits can pass to new parties. [1][8]  \n   - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract is silent, so there is no explicit non‑transferability allocation. [3]\n\n3. **Different documents, different risk‑allocation strategies**  \n   - The Property Management Agreement uses **insurance + indemnity + liability limitation** to allocate risk between Owner and Agent. [8][13][16]  \n   - The Builder’s Limited Warranty uses **narrow express warranty + broad exclusions + disclaimer of implied warranties + non‑transferability + arbitration** to tightly control the Builder’s exposure. [2][4][5][8][9][14][15][17][19][21][22]  \n   - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract is primarily operational and regulatory (service and reporting obligations) and does not contain explicit risk‑allocation clauses. [3]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn response to the original query—“List the three different ‘risk allocation’ statements across the set (risk of loss, liability limitations, non‑transferability)”—the synthesized answer is:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Owner bears risk of loss for bodily injury and property damage via required liability insurance naming Agent as additional insured and via indemnity; Agent is only exposed for its gross negligence or willful misconduct. [8][13][16]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Builder assumes limited risk (repair/replace certain defects within defined periods) and excludes many categories of damage and loss, leaving most risk of loss with the Buyer/Owner. [2][4][14][17][19][21][22]  \n   - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: No explicit risk‑of‑loss allocation; risk is left to general law. [3]\n\n2. **Liability limitations**  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Agent “shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury” on the property except for gross negligence or willful misconduct, and Owner must hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent; Agent also disclaims any guarantees of occupancy or income. [8][16]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: Builder excludes consequential and incidental damages, disclaims all implied warranties, excludes numerous categories of damage (including bodily injury and damage to personal property), and imposes strict time limits on claims, thereby sharply limiting liability. [4][14][15][17][19][21][22]  \n   - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: No express liability limitation provisions. [3]\n\n3. **Non‑transferability**  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty: “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [8][9]  \n   - Property Management Agreement: Expressly binding on “successors and assigns of Owner or Agent,” indicating transferability rather than non‑transferability. [1][8]  \n   - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: No explicit non‑transferability clause; changes or new contracts must be filed with the municipality and County, but transferability is not directly addressed. [3]\n\nThese three categories—risk of loss, liability limitations, and non‑transferability—together show how each document structures and allocates legal and financial risk among the parties.",

Which entity is identified as the **vendor** on the **invoice**?\n\nAcross the provided documents, several entities appear (Contoso Ltd., Walt Flood Realty, Fabrikam Inc.), but none of the documents is an **invoice**. We have:\n\n- A **Property Management Agreement** between Contoso Ltd. (“Owner”) and Walt Flood Realty (“Agent”). [1]  \n- A **Builder’s Limited Warranty** between Fabrikam Inc. (“Builder”) and Contoso Ltd. (“Buyer/Owner”). [2]  \n- A **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** between Contoso Ltd. (“Holding Tank Owner”) and Fabrikam Inc. (“Pumper”). [3]\n\nThese are contracts and a warranty, not invoices, and none of them designates any party as a “vendor” on an invoice. Therefore, from the available evidence, no entity can be identified as the **vendor on the invoice**, because no invoice is present in the context.\n\n### 2. What is the exact **VAT / Tax ID number of the vendor** as it appears on the **invoice**?\n\nBecause there is no invoice in the provided documents, there is also no VAT / Tax ID number shown for any party in the role of vendor on an invoice.\n\nThe only tax-related identifiers mentioned are:\n\n- The Owner must provide the Agent with the Owner’s **General Excise Tax License** and **U.S. Federal Tax ID or Social Security number** in the Property Management Agreement. [4][6]  \n- A **Tax ID# 0098765** appears in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract, but it is clearly labeled as a **property-related Tax ID** (parcel/municipal tax identifier), not a vendor VAT or business tax ID on an invoice. [3]\n\nNone of these is presented as a **vendor VAT / Tax ID on an invoice**, and no VAT number is given at all.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The original query depends on the existence of an **invoice** that identifies a **vendor** and shows that vendor’s **VAT / Tax ID**.\n- The sub-questions correctly break this into:\n  1. Identify the vendor on the invoice.\n  2. Extract that vendor’s VAT / Tax ID as shown on the invoice.\n- However, the evidence set contains only agreements and a warranty, not an invoice. [1][2][3]\n- The only explicit “Tax ID# 0098765” is tied to a parcel/property in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract, not to a vendor on an invoice. [3]\n- The Property Management Agreement references that the Owner must provide tax identifiers, but does not list any specific numbers. [4][6]\n\nThus, both sub-questions cannot be fully answered as posed, because the necessary document type (an invoice) is missing.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the documents provided, there is **no invoice** and therefore **no vendor VAT / Tax ID number on an invoice** available to report. The only tax-related number shown is a property Tax ID (`Tax ID# 0098765`) in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract, which is not a vendor VAT/Tax ID on an invoice. [3]",

Identify the vendor on the “invoice”\n\nAcross the provided documents, several entities appear, but we must determine which one is acting as the *vendor* in a context where an invoice (or invoice-like billing relationship) exists.\n\n- In the **Property Management Agreement**, Walt Flood Realty is the “Agent” providing property management services to Contoso Ltd. (“Owner”). The Agent:\n  - Advertises the rental unit and “Provide[s] the invoice(s) from the media, and pay the charges and pass on the cost to the Owner, on the monthly proceeds statements.” [1]\n  - Charges various management fees and “will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.” [1]\n\n  In this relationship, Walt Flood Realty is effectively the service provider (vendor) billing the Owner for management services and related charges. [1]\n\n- In the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, Fabrikam Inc. is the “Pumper” providing holding tank servicing to Contoso Ltd. (the “Holding Tank Owner”). [3] The owner “agrees to pay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.” [3] Here, Fabrikam Inc. is the vendor of pumping services.\n\n- The **Builder’s Limited Warranty** is a warranty agreement between Fabrikam Inc. (Builder) and Contoso Ltd. (Buyer/Owner) related to home construction/purchase. [2] It is not structured as an invoice and does not show tax identifiers.\n\nNone of the excerpts, however, show an actual *invoice document* with a VAT or Tax ID field. They only show contracts/agreements that would give rise to invoices.\n\nGiven the original query—“What is the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice?”—we look for any explicit VAT, Tax ID, or similar identifier for the service-providing party (vendor) in these documents.\n\n### 2. Search for the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number\n\nWe must distinguish between:\n\n- The **vendor’s** tax ID (what the question asks for), and  \n- Any **other party’s** tax or license numbers that appear in the documents.\n\nFrom the evidence:\n\n1. **Property Management Agreement (Walt Flood Realty as Agent/vendor)**  \n   - The agreement requires the *Owner* to:\n     - “Provide Agent with Owner's General Excise Tax License.” [6][8]  \n     - “Provide Agent with Owner's U.S. Federal Tax Id, or Social Security number.” [6][8]  \n   - These are clearly the **Owner’s** tax identifiers, not the Agent’s. No VAT, Tax ID, or similar number is given for Walt Flood Realty in the text. [1][6][8]\n\n2. **Holding Tank Servicing Contract (Fabrikam Inc. as Pumper/vendor)**  \n   - The contract includes:\n     - A **Parcel ID #** and a **Tax ID# 0098765** in the property description block. [3]  \n   - This “Tax ID# 0098765” is associated with the property/parcel (it appears alongside “Parcel ID # …” and legal description), not explicitly with the Pumper (Fabrikam Inc.) as a business tax identifier. [3]  \n   - The Pumper’s business identifier shown is a **Pumper's Registration Number REG-54321**. [3] This is a service registration number, not a VAT or general tax ID.  \n   - No VAT number or business tax ID is provided for Fabrikam Inc. in this contract. [3]\n\n3. **Builder’s Limited Warranty (Fabrikam Inc. as Builder)**  \n   - The document identifies Fabrikam Inc. as the Builder and gives an address and contact details. [2]  \n   - It does not list any VAT number, Tax ID, EIN, or similar identifier for Fabrikam Inc. [2]\n\nThus, across all documents, there is:\n\n- A requirement that the **Owner** provide its own tax license and federal tax ID to the Agent. [6][8]  \n- A **property Tax ID# 0098765** that appears to be a local property tax identifier, not a vendor’s business tax ID. [3]  \n- A **Pumper’s Registration Number REG-54321** for Fabrikam Inc. as a service provider. [3]  \n- No explicit VAT number or business tax ID for Walt Flood Realty or Fabrikam Inc. in any of the excerpts. [1][2][3]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The sub-question about identifying the vendor shows that:\n  - Walt Flood Realty is the vendor/Agent in the property management context. [1]\n  - Fabrikam Inc. is the vendor/Pumper in the holding tank servicing context. [3]\n\n- When we then look for any VAT / Tax ID associated with these vendors:\n  - The Property Management Agreement only references the **Owner’s** General Excise Tax License and U.S. Federal Tax ID, not the Agent’s. [6][8]\n  - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract shows a **Tax ID# 0098765**, but in context it is tied to the property’s legal/parcel information, not to Fabrikam Inc. as a business tax identifier. [3]\n  - The only explicit identifier for the Pumper is **REG-54321**, a registration number, not a VAT/Tax ID. [3]\n  - The Builder’s Limited Warranty provides no tax identifiers at all for the Builder. [2]\n\nTherefore, even after identifying who the vendor is in each relationship, the documents do not provide a vendor VAT or business tax ID number.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number **is not stated anywhere in the provided documents**. The only tax-related numbers present are:\n\n- The **Owner’s** required General Excise Tax License and U.S. Federal Tax ID (not the vendor’s). [6][8]  \n- A **property Tax ID# 0098765**, which is a parcel/property tax identifier, not a vendor business tax ID. [3]  \n- A **Pumper’s Registration Number REG-54321** for Fabrikam Inc., which is a service registration, not a VAT/Tax ID. [3]\n\nAccordingly, the vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice cannot be determined from the given evidence.",

Identify the vendor on the invoice\n\nAcross the provided documents, several entities appear:\n\n- **Contoso Ltd.** – appears as “Owner” in the Property Management Agreement and as Buyer/Owner in the Builder’s Limited Warranty, and as Holding Tank Owner in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract.[1][2][3]  \n- **Walt Flood Realty** – appears as “Agent” (a Hawaii sole proprietorship) in the Property Management Agreement.[1]  \n- **Fabrikam Inc.** – appears as “Builder” in the Builder’s Limited Warranty,[2] and as “Pumper” in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract.[3]\n\nHowever, none of the excerpts provided is actually an **invoice**. They are contracts/agreements (property management agreement, builder’s warranty, holding tank servicing contract), and none is formatted or labeled as an invoice, nor do they contain invoice-specific fields such as invoice number, invoice date, line items, or tax/VAT fields.\n\nBecause there is no invoice document in the evidence, we cannot definitively determine which of these entities is the “vendor” on an invoice, nor can we see any invoice header that would identify a vendor for billing purposes.\n\n### 2. Vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice\n\nThe question asks specifically: “What is the vendor's VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice?”\n\nWithin the provided documents:\n\n- The Property Management Agreement requires the **Owner** (Contoso Ltd.) to provide:\n  - “Owner's General Excise Tax License”[4][6]\n  - “Owner's U.S. Federal Tax Id, or Social Security number”[4][6]\n\n  These are obligations stated in the contract; the actual numbers are **not** shown anywhere in the text.[4][6]\n\n- The Holding Tank Servicing Contract includes:\n  - A **Parcel ID #** and a **Tax ID# 0098765** for the property.[3]  \n    This “Tax ID# 0098765” is clearly labeled as a property-related tax identifier (tied to the parcel description), not as a business VAT/TIN for a vendor.[3]\n\n- No document shows:\n  - A VAT number\n  - A business tax ID number for Walt Flood Realty\n  - A business tax ID number for Fabrikam Inc.\n  - A business tax ID number for Contoso Ltd.\n\nCrucially, because we do not have an invoice, we cannot see what tax identifier (if any) is printed on it for the vendor. The only explicit “Tax ID#” in the evidence is a **property tax ID** in the holding tank contract, not a vendor’s VAT/TIN.[3]\n\nTherefore, there is **no evidence** in the provided documents that states a vendor’s VAT number or business tax ID as it would appear on an invoice.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The sub-question about identifying the vendor cannot be fully answered because no invoice is present; we only see parties to contracts (Owner, Agent, Builder, Pumper).[1][2][3]\n- The only explicit “Tax ID# 0098765” is tied to a parcel in the Holding Tank Servicing Contract, not to a vendor’s business tax registration.[3]\n- The Property Management Agreement mentions that the Owner must provide tax identifiers (General Excise Tax License and U.S. Federal Tax ID/SSN), but those numbers are not disclosed in the text.[4][6]\n- Since the original query is about the **vendor’s** VAT/Tax ID **on the invoice**, and no invoice or vendor tax field is shown, the requested information is not available in the evidence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number on the invoice **cannot be determined from the provided documents**. No invoice is included, and none of the texts shows a vendor VAT or business tax ID number. The only “Tax ID# 0098765” present is a property tax identifier, not a vendor VAT/Tax ID.[3]",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Identify the property management Agent\n\nThe “PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Short Term and/or Vacation/Holiday Rentals)” explicitly defines the parties as:\n\n- Owner: Contoso Ltd.  \n- Agent: “Walt Flood Realty, a Hawaii sole proprietorship (hereinafter called ‘Agent’)” [1][5][8].\n\nThus, the property management Agent referred to in the query is **Walt Flood Realty**.  \n\n### 2. Locate where the Agent’s license number is recorded\n\nReviewing the full text of the Property Management Agreement, the document:\n\n- Names and describes the Agent and its duties [1][5][8][10].  \n- Details the Agent’s fees and other financial terms [14][15][16][18].  \n- Includes signature lines for the Owner and the Agent’s “Principal Broker” [7].  \n\nHowever, nowhere in this agreement is there any field, label, or text indicating a **license number** for Walt Flood Realty or its principal broker. The only license-related reference in the agreement concerns the **Owner’s General Excise Tax License**, which the Owner must provide to the Agent [4][6][11], not a real estate or property management license for the Agent.\n\nThe other documents provided:\n\n- The **Builders Limited Warranty** concerns Fabrikam Inc. as Builder and Contoso Ltd. as Buyer/Owner, with no mention of any property management agent or license number [2].  \n- The **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** concerns Contoso Ltd. as Holding Tank Owner and Fabrikam Inc. as Pumper, and includes a “Pumper’s Registration Number REG-54321” [3], but this is clearly a **pumper’s registration number**, not a property management Agent’s license number.\n\nTherefore, within the supplied documents and context, there is **no location** where a license number for Walt Flood Realty is stated or recorded.\n\n### 3. Determine the exact license number\n\nBecause the Property Management Agreement does not contain any license number for Walt Flood Realty [1][5][7][8][14][15][16][18], and the other documents relate to different parties and different types of registrations (e.g., “Pumper’s Registration Number REG-54321” for Fabrikam Inc. as a pumper [3]), there is **no evidence** in the provided materials that specifies a license number for the property management Agent.\n\nThus, the exact license number of the property management Agent **cannot be determined** from the given evidence.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The Agent is clearly identified as **Walt Flood Realty** in the Property Management Agreement [1][5][8].  \n- The agreement does discuss licenses, but only in relation to the **Owner’s General Excise Tax License**, not the Agent’s license [4][6][11].  \n- Other documents in the evidence set (Builders Limited Warranty and Holding Tank Servicing Contract) involve different roles and entities (Fabrikam Inc. as Builder or Pumper) and include a **pumper’s registration number** (REG-54321) [3], which is unrelated to property management licensing.  \n- Since no document in the set records a license number for Walt Flood Realty, the original query cannot be answered with a specific number based on the evidence.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the provided documents, the property management Agent is **Walt Flood Realty** [1][5][8], but **no license number for this Agent is stated anywhere in the evidence**.

What payment-related instructions are required by the **purchase contract**?\n\nThe purchase contract between Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor) and Fabrikam Inc. (Customer) specifies **only the timing and amounts of payments**, not the method (e.g., wire, ACH, check) or any bank-routing details.\n\nUnder “Payment Terms,” the contract states that the **total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments**:  \n- **$20,000.00 upon signing**  \n- **$7,000.00 upon delivery**  \n- **$2,900.00 upon completion** [2][8][6]\n\nThese are the only payment-related requirements in the purchase contract: the amounts, the milestones, and the fact that the contract is effective upon mutual signature and **initial payment** [2][7][19]. There is **no clause** in the purchase contract that:\n\n- Specifies wire transfer or ACH as the required payment method, or  \n- Provides any bank account, routing number, or other wire/ACH instructions.\n\nThus, the purchase contract requires that the Customer make the three installment payments at the specified milestones, but it does **not** prescribe wire/ACH as the method, nor does it provide any wire/ACH details.\n\n### 2. To whom must any payment instructions be directed, and how are those parties and roles described?\n\nWithin the purchase contract itself:\n\n- **Contoso Lifts LLC** is identified as the **“Contractor”** [2][7].  \n- **Fabrikam Inc.** is identified as the **“Customer”** [2][7].\n\nThe contract states that the **Customer** is to pay the **Contractor** the total contract price in the three installments described above [2][8]. However, it does not say *how* those payments must be transmitted (no mention of wire, ACH, check, or portal) and does not give any banking instructions.\n\nIn the related **invoice** from Contoso Lifts LLC (which is consistent with the same parties and price), the payment instructions are more specific, but still not wire/ACH:\n\n- It states: **“Make all checks payable to Contoso Lifts LLC”** [3][4].  \n- It also notes that **“Payments can also be made via our online portal: https://ww.contosolifts.com/portal/pay”** [3][4].  \n- The invoice is issued by **Contoso Lifts LLC** to **Fabrikam Construction / John Doe** at the same address as Fabrikam Inc. in the contract [3][4][7].\n\nFrom this, the only explicit payment directions in the provided documents are:\n\n- Payee: **Contoso Lifts LLC** (the Contractor) [2][7][3][4].  \n- Methods mentioned: **checks** payable to Contoso Lifts LLC and **online portal** payments [3][4].  \n\nAgain, there is **no mention** of wire transfer or ACH instructions, nor any bank account details, in either the purchase contract or the invoice.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **purchase contract** defines **who pays whom, how much, and when** (Customer pays Contractor $29,900 in three milestones) [2][8], but **does not define payment method** or provide any wire/ACH details.\n- The **invoice** from the same Contractor provides **practical payment instructions** (checks to Contoso Lifts LLC and an online portal) [3][4], which clarifies how payments are typically made, but still **does not introduce wire/ACH instructions**.\n- Both documents consistently identify **Contoso Lifts LLC as the payee/Contractor** and **Fabrikam (Customer/Construction) as the payer** [2][7][3][4], so if wire/ACH were to be arranged, it would logically be directed to Contoso Lifts LLC—but that is **not stated** in the contract.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe purchase contract does **not** contain any required **wire transfer or ACH instructions**. It only requires that the Customer (Fabrikam Inc.) pay the Contractor (Contoso Lifts LLC) a total of $29,900 in three installments tied to signing, delivery, and completion [2][8]. No bank account, routing number, or explicit wire/ACH method is specified in the contract, and the related invoice only instructs that checks be made payable to Contoso Lifts LLC or payments be made via an online portal, not by wire or ACH [3][4].",

(Customer) sets out **only the amounts, timing, and conditions of payments**, not any banking or transfer details.\n\nKey payment terms:\n\n- **Total contract price**: $29,900.00 [2], [6], [8].  \n- **Installment schedule**:  \n  - $20,000.00 upon signing [2], [8]  \n  - $7,000.00 upon delivery [2], [8]  \n  - $2,900.00 upon completion [2], [8]  \n- The contract is effective upon **mutual signature and initial payment** [7], [19].  \n- Changes must be agreed in writing and will affect the **next payment milestone** [2], [6], [8].  \n- Failure to pay may result in legal action, and **legal fees are recoverable by Contractor** [2], [8], [12].  \n\nNowhere in the purchase contract text is there any mention of:\n\n- Wire transfers  \n- ACH transfers  \n- Bank account numbers, routing numbers, or specific financial institutions  \n- Any instruction that payment must be made by a particular method (e.g., check, wire, ACH, credit card)\n\nThus, the **only payment requirements** in the purchase contract are *what* must be paid, *when* it must be paid, and the consequences of non‑payment; there are **no specified wire/ACH instructions** in the contract itself [2], [6], [7], [8], [19].\n\n### 2.

Box 123567, Key West, FL 33304‑0708 [2], [7], [19].  \n- **Customer (payer)**: Fabrikam Inc., 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155 [2], [7], [19].  \n\nThe contract does not describe any:\n\n- Bank accounts belonging to Contoso Lifts LLC or Fabrikam Inc.  \n- “Wire instructions,” “ACH instructions,” or similar language  \n- Requirement that payments be made by wire or ACH to any particular account\n\nThe **invoice** from Contoso Lifts LLC, which is related to the same type of lift transaction, does give some payment guidance, but still not wire/ACH details:\n\n- It instructs: “Make all checks payable to Contoso Lifts LLC” [3], [4].  \n- It also notes: “Payments can also be made via our online portal: https://ww.contosolifts.com/portal/pay” [3], [4].  \n\nThese invoice instructions indicate that:\n\n- Payments are to be made **to Contoso Lifts LLC** as payee [3], [4].  \n- Acceptable methods include **checks** and an **online portal** [3], [4].  \n\nHowever:\n\n- The invoice does **not** provide any bank name, routing number, or account number for wire or ACH.  \n- The invoice is a separate document from the purchase contract; the contract itself does not incorporate any specific wire/ACH instructions by reference in the provided text.\n\nTherefore, even when considering both the purchase contract and the related invoice, there are **no explicit wire transfer or ACH instructions**—only that payments go to Contoso Lifts LLC, typically by check or via an online portal [2], [3], [4], [7], [19].\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **payment obligations** (amounts and timing) are clearly defined in the purchase contract [2], [6], [8], but **no method** (wire, ACH, etc.) is mandated or described there.  \n- The **identity of the payee** (Contoso Lifts LLC) and payer (Fabrikam Inc.) is clearly set out in the contract [2], [7], [19], which is the necessary context for any payment instructions, but the contract stops short of specifying any bank or transfer details.  \n- The **invoice** supplements the contract by indicating that checks should be made payable to Contoso Lifts LLC and that an online portal can be used [3], [4], yet it still does not provide wire/ACH routing or account information.  \n- No other provided document (Holding Tank Servicing Contract [1], Property Management Agreement [5], [20]) relates to this purchase contract’s payment mechanics or contains wire/ACH instructions for this transaction.\n\nTogether, these points show that while the parties and payment schedule are defined, **wire/ACH instructions are not**.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe purchase contract between Contoso Lifts LLC and Fabrikam Inc. **does not contain any required wire transfer or ACH instructions**. It specifies the total price and installment schedule [2], [6], [8], and identifies Contoso Lifts LLC as the payee [2], [7], [19], but it does not provide bank account details or mandate wire/ACH as a payment method. The related invoice directs that checks be made payable to Contoso Lifts LLC and allows payment via an online portal [3], [4], yet still does not supply wire/ACH routing or account information.

Exact wire transfer / ACH instructions in the purchase contract\n\nThe **purchase contract** provided sets out the parties, scope of work, price, and payment milestones, but it does **not** specify any bank details or electronic payment instructions.\n\nWhat the contract does say about payment:\n\n- Total contract price is **$29,900.00**, payable in three installments:  \n  - **$20,000.00 upon signing**  \n  - **$7,000.00 upon delivery**  \n  - **$2,900.00 upon completion**  \n  [4] [10] [12]\n\n- The contract is between **Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor)** and **Fabrikam Inc. (Customer)**, and is effective upon mutual signature and **initial payment**. [4] [11] [23]\n\nHowever, nowhere in the purchase contract text is there any mention of:\n\n- Bank name  \n- Account name  \n- Account number  \n- Routing/ABA number  \n- ACH instructions  \n- Wire transfer instructions  \n- Required reference or memo language\n\nThe only related payment detail in the broader materials appears in the **invoice**, which is a separate document, not the purchase contract. The invoice states:\n\n- “**Make all checks payable to Contoso Lifts LLC**” [6]  \n- It also notes that “**Payments can also be made via our online portal: https://ww.contosolifts.com/portal/pay**” [6] [7]\n\nEven in the invoice, there are still **no wire or ACH bank coordinates** (no bank name, routing number, or account number). The invoice only gives a payee name for checks and an online portal URL. [6] [7]\n\nTherefore, based on the provided documents, the **purchase contract itself does not contain any wire transfer or ACH instructions**, and no other attached exhibit or clause supplies those details.\n\n### 2. To whom the wire/ACH instructions must be directed or from whom they must be obtained\n\nFrom the contract:\n\n- The party to be paid is the **Contractor, Contoso Lifts LLC**, whose mailing address is:  \n  “Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor), located at, **P.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL 33304-0708**” [4] [11]\n\n- The **Customer** is Fabrikam Inc., located at 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155. [4] [11]\n\nThe invoice confirms the payee and provides contact information:\n\n- “Make all checks payable to **Contoso Lifts LLC**” [6]  \n- Company contact details:  \n  - Contoso Lifts LLC, P.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL 33304-0708 [7]  \n  - Phone: (561) 353-5111; Fax: (561) 211-7333 [7]  \n  - Contact person: **Jim Contoso**, phone (305) 490-5997, email **jim@contosolifts.com** [6]\n\nThe contract and invoice together make clear that:\n\n- **Payments are owed to Contoso Lifts LLC (the Contractor)**. [4] [11] [6] [7]  \n- Any specific **wire or ACH instructions would necessarily have to be obtained from Contoso Lifts LLC**, likely via the contact information on the invoice (e.g., Jim Contoso or the main office). [6] [7]\n\nBut the documents do **not** explicitly say “wire instructions must be obtained from X” or “direct wire to Y.” That is an inference from the fact that Contoso Lifts LLC is the payee and no bank details are provided in the contract.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Sub-question 1 (exact instructions):**  \n  The purchase contract only defines *amounts* and *timing* of payments, not *method* or *banking coordinates*. [4] [10] [12] There are no wire/ACH fields or clauses, so the answer is that **no wire/ACH instructions are specified in the contract**.\n\n- **Sub-question 2 (who to direct/obtain from):**  \n  The contract and invoice identify **Contoso Lifts LLC** as the party to be paid and provide its mailing address and contact details. [4] [11] [6] [7] Thus, any wire/ACH instructions would have to be **requested from Contoso Lifts LLC (e.g., via the contact listed on the invoice)**, since they are the payee and no bank details are otherwise given.\n\nTogether, these show that the original query cannot be answered with concrete bank fields from the contract, but it can be answered in terms of **who must provide those details** and the fact that the contract itself is silent on them.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe **purchase contract does not contain any explicit wire transfer or ACH instructions**—it specifies only the payment amounts and milestones, not bank name, account number, routing/ABA number, or memo/reference language. [4] [10] [12]\n\nThe party to be paid under the contract is **Contoso Lifts LLC (the Contractor)**, and any required wire/ACH instructions would need to be obtained directly from Contoso Lifts LLC using the contact information provided in the related invoice (e.g., Jim Contoso or the Contoso Lifts LLC office).

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Location of the **\"SHIPPED VIA\"** field\n\nThe provided evidence includes:\n\n- A **Property Management Agreement** between Contoso Ltd. and Walt Flood Realty, which covers agency, responsibilities, fees, start-up fee, and legal terms, but contains no invoice layout or shipping section and no field labeled **\"SHIPPED VIA\"**. [1][6]  \n- A **Builder’s Limited Warranty** between Fabrikam Inc. and Contoso Ltd., which describes warranty terms, exclusions, arbitration, and signatures, but again is not an invoice and contains no shipping or “SHIPPED VIA” field. [2][5]  \n- A **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, which is a service agreement describing responsibilities of owner and pumper, property description, and signatures, with no invoice or shipping method field. [3][22]  \n- A **Purchase Contract** for a vertical platform lift, which sets out scope of work, payment terms, delivery expectations, and legal terms, but is a contract, not an invoice, and does not contain any field labeled “SHIPPED VIA” or any explicit shipping-method field. [4][9][10][12][15]\n\nNone of these documents is an invoice, and none shows a section or field explicitly labeled **\"SHIPPED VIA\"**. Therefore, within the supplied evidence, there is no identifiable location of a **\"SHIPPED VIA\"** field.\n\n### 2. Value/text in the **\"SHIPPED VIA\"** field\n\nBecause no document in the evidence set contains an invoice or a field labeled **\"SHIPPED VIA\"**, there is no visible value or text that specifies a shipping method. The documents discuss:\n\n- Management fees, taxes, and start-up fees (Property Management Agreement) [1][6]  \n- Warranty coverage, exclusions, and arbitration (Builder’s Limited Warranty) [2][5]  \n- Servicing obligations and reporting for a holding tank (Holding Tank Servicing Contract) [3][22]  \n- Delivery timing and risk of loss in a purchase contract, but only in general terms (“Delivery expected 8–10 weeks after drawing approval”; “Contractor holds risk until delivery”), not as a structured invoice field or shipping-method entry. [4][10][12]\n\nNone of these passages provides a discrete “SHIPPED VIA” value such as a carrier name or shipping mode.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The original query assumes the existence of an **invoice** with a **\"SHIPPED VIA\"** field.  \n- All four provided documents are **contracts or agreements**, not invoices: property management, warranty, servicing contract, and purchase contract.

Location of the **\"SHIPPED VIA\"** field\n\nThe provided evidence includes:\n\n- A **Property Management Agreement** between Contoso Ltd. and Walt Flood Realty, which covers agency, responsibilities, fees, start-up fee, and legal terms, but contains no invoice layout or shipping section and no field labeled **\"SHIPPED VIA\"**. [1][6]  \n- A **Builder’s Limited Warranty** between Fabrikam Inc. and Contoso Ltd., which describes warranty terms, exclusions, arbitration, and signatures, but again is not an invoice and contains no shipping or “SHIPPED VIA” field. [2][5]  \n- A **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, which is a service agreement describing responsibilities of owner and pumper, property description, and signatures, with no invoice or shipping method field. [3][22]  \n- A **Purchase Contract** for a vertical platform lift, which sets out scope of work, payment terms, delivery expectations, and legal terms, but is a contract, not an invoice, and does not contain any field labeled “SHIPPED VIA” or any explicit shipping-method field.
