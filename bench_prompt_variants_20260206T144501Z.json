[3][4]  \n   - Ambiguity: whether a defect discovered on the last day but notified slightly later is covered.  \n   - Clarification: state whether the defect must occur, be discovered, and/or be reported within the period, and whether post\u2011period notice is allowed for defects discovered on the last day.\n\n6. **Repair completion within 60 days (Builder)**  \n   - Text allows extension for \u201cweather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages.\u201d [1][3][4]  \n   - Ambiguity: no maximum extension or requirement to notify Buyer of delays.  \n   - Clarification: add a requirement for written notice of delay and a maximum extension period or \u201ccommercially reasonable efforts\u201d standard.\n\n7\u20138. **Arbitration timing (Builder)**  \n   - Demand window: \u201cnot more than 60 days after service of a complaint\u2026\u201d [1][3][4]  \n   - Ambiguity: what happens if a party demands arbitration after 60 days; whether that waives arbitration.  \n   - Clarification: specify consequences of missing the 60\u2011day window (e.g., waiver of arbitration right).  \n   - 180\u2011day conclusion: aspirational (\u201cto the maximum extent practicable\u201d). [9][10][11]  \n   - Ambiguity: no remedy if arbitration exceeds 180 days.  \n   - Clarification: state whether exceeding 180 days has any legal consequence or is purely a goal.\n\n9. **Labor warranty 90 days (Purchase Contract)**  \n   - Ambiguity: exact start date (delivery vs. completion vs. invoice date) is not explicitly stated; only \u201cupon completion\u201d is used for payment, not for warranty start. [2][6]  \n   - Clarification: define that the 90 days runs from the date of completion/acceptance of work.\n\n10. **3 business\u2011day cancellation (Purchase Contract)**  \n   - Ambiguity: what counts as a \u201cbusiness day\u201d (e.g., holidays, Saturdays). [2][6]  \n   - Clarification: define business days (e.g., Monday\u2013Friday excluding federal holidays) and the method/time of day by which notice must be given.\n\n11. **60\u2011day termination notice (Property Management)**  \n   - Ambiguity: when the 60 days starts (date of mailing vs. receipt). [5]  \n   - Clarification: specify that the notice period begins on the date of receipt or a defined deemed\u2011receipt rule.\n\n12. **5 business\u2011day listing notice (Property Management)**  \n   - Ambiguity: same \u201cbusiness day\u201d definition issue as above. [5]  \n   - Clarification: define business days and acceptable notice methods (email, mail, etc.).\n\n13\u201314. **180\u2011day thresholds for short vs. long term (Property Management)**  \n   - Ambiguity: exact treatment of a reservation of exactly 180 days (the text says \u201cless than 180\u201d and \u201cmore than 180,\u201d leaving 180 itself unclassified). [5][7][8]  \n   - Clarification: explicitly state how exactly 180\u2011day reservations are treated (short\u2011term or long\u2011term).\n\n15. **10 business\u2011day filing window (Holding Tank Contract)**  \n   - Ambiguity: again, definition of \u201cbusiness days\u201d and what constitutes \u201cfiling\u201d (mailing vs. receipt). [14]  \n   - Clarification: define business days and specify that filing is effective upon receipt or upon postmark, as desired.\n\n---\n\n### Q5 \u2013 Functional operation of each day\u2011defined timeframe in context\n\nHow each window operates in practice:\n\n1\u20132. **Builder warranty windows**  \n   - Operate as the primary coverage periods: if a defect arises and is reported within the applicable 1\u2011year or 60\u2011day window, the Builder is obligated to repair/replace under the warranty. [12][3][4]\n\n3\u20135. **Builder termination/claim/notification windows**  \n   - These windows function together: coverage exists only during the defined term, and the Buyer must submit written claims and notifications before the term ends; otherwise, the claim is barred. [3][4]\n\n6. **Builder 60\u2011day repair window**  \n   - Once a valid claim is made, this window governs the Builder\u2019s performance timeline, subject to specified delays. [1][3][4]\n\n7\u20138. **Arbitration timing windows**  \n   - The 60\u2011day demand window channels disputes into arbitration early in litigation. [1][3][4]  \n   - The 180\u2011day target encourages efficient arbitration and allows arbitrators to sanction delay. [9][10][11]\n\n9. **90\u2011day labor warranty (Purchase Contract)**  \n   - After installation, any labor\u2011related issues arising within 90 days must be corrected by the Contractor at no additional labor cost, aligning with the invoice and contract relationship. [2][6][15]\n\n10. **3 business\u2011day cancellation window (Purchase Contract)**  \n   - Immediately after signing, the customer has a short, clearly defined period to cancel and receive a full refund; after that, the deposit becomes non\u2011refundable, shifting risk to the customer. [2][6]\n\n11. **60\u2011day termination notice (Property Management)**  \n   - Provides a buffer for both Owner and Agent to manage existing reservations and financial obligations before the relationship ends. [5]\n\n12. **5 business\u2011day listing notice (Property Management)**  \n   - Ensures the Agent is quickly informed of a potential sale, allowing coordination of showings and rentals and avoiding conflicts. [5]\n\n13\u201314. **<180 / >180\u2011day thresholds (Property Management)**  \n   - Operationally, these thresholds determine which commission rate applies (25% for short\u2011term, 10% for long\u2011term) and may affect marketing and management strategies. [5][7][8]\n\n15. **10 business\u2011day filing window (Holding Tank Contract)**  \n   - Ensures that regulatory authorities are promptly updated when the service contract changes, maintaining compliance with WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5. [14]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Risk allocation over time:**  \n  - Builder warranty periods (1 year / 60 days) [12][3][4], the 90\u2011day labor warranty [2][6], and the 3\u2011day cancellation right [2][6] all define when risk and responsibility shift between parties.\n\n- **Procedural vs. substantive windows:**  \n  - Some windows define substantive rights (warranty coverage, cancellation, rental classification) [12][2][5], while others are procedural (claim deadlines, arbitration demand and conclusion, notice periods, regulatory filing deadlines) [3][4][9][10][11][5][14].\n\n- **Short vs. long horizon:**  \n  - Very short windows (3 business days, 5 business days, 10 business days, 60 days) govern immediate actions and notices [2][5][14].  \n  - Longer windows (90 days, 1 year, 180 days) govern ongoing obligations and classifications [12][2][5][7][8][9][10][11].\n\n- **Classification thresholds:**  \n  - The 180\u2011day thresholds in the Property Management Agreement [5][7][8] are used not as deadlines but as dividing lines between categories (short\u2011term vs. long\u2011term), similar in spirit to how 1\u2011year vs. 60\u2011day periods separate categories of warranty coverage. [12]\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe explicit day\u2011based time windows across the corpus are:\n\n- Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty: 1\u2011year and 60\u2011day warranty periods; claim and notification deadlines tied to those periods; a 60\u2011day repair window; a 60\u2011day arbitration demand window; and a 180\u2011day arbitration conclusion target. [1][3][4][9][10][11][12]  \n- Purchase Contract: a 90\u2011day labor warranty and a 3\u2011business\u2011day cancellation right. [2][6]  \n- Property Management Agreement: a 60\u2011day termination notice, a 5\u2011business\u2011day listing\u2011notice requirement, and 180\u2011day thresholds distinguishing short\u2011term from long\u2011term rentals. [5][7][8]  \n- Holding Tank Servicing Contract: a 10\u2011business\u2011day window to file changes to the service contract with authorities. [14]\n\nEach of these windows serves a specific functional role\u2014defining coverage periods, procedural deadlines, classification thresholds, or notice requirements\u2014and together they structure how rights, obligations, and risks evolve over time in the respective agreements.",

Unknowns:  \n     - Exact start date is \u201cdate of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first,\u201d[3] but the text does not specify how disputes over that date are resolved.  \n     - Whether \u201cdays\u201d means calendar days (likely) vs. business days is not explicitly stated.\n\n2. **1\u2011year warranty (Builder)**[12]  \n   - Unknowns:  \n     - Same start\u2011date ambiguity as above.[3]  \n     -

How multiple amended pleadings affect the 60\u2011day calculation is not fully detailed (though \u201cany amendment to any of the above\u201d is mentioned[1]).\n\n5. **180\u2011day arbitration\u2011completion target (Builder)**[9][10][11]  \n   - Unknowns:  \n     - It is a \u201cto the maximum extent practicable\u201d target[9][10][11], so it is unclear what happens if arbitration reasonably cannot be completed in 180 days beyond possible sanctions.  \n     - No explicit consequence for exceeding 180 days other than arbitrator\u2019s sanction power.\n\n6. **90\u2011day labor warranty (Purchase Contract)**[2][6]  \n   - Unknowns:  \n     - Start date is not explicitly stated (signing, delivery, or completion?).  \n     -

Unknowns:  \n      - How exactly 180\u2011day reservations/leases are treated (equal to 180 days is not explicitly assigned to either category).  \n      - Whether \u201cdays\u201d are consecutive calendar days or some other measure (e.g., nights).\n\n11. **10\u2011business\u2011day filing window (Holding Tank Contract)**[14]  \n    - Unknowns:  \n      - Definition of \u201cbusiness days\u201d (weekends/holidays).  \n      - Consequences of late filing are not specified in this contract (may be governed by external law).\n\n---\n\n### Q4: For each day\u2011based window, what is its exact length in days and its stated or implied purpose?\n\nSummarizing each:\n\n1. **60\u2011day warranty (Builder)** \u2013 60 days  \n   - **Length:** 60 days.[12]  \n   - **Purpose:** Warranty coverage for specified minor items.[12]\n\n2. **1\u2011year warranty (Builder)** \u2013 ~365 days  \n   - **Length:** One (1) year.[12]  \n   - **Purpose:** Warranty coverage for structural and major systems.[12]\n\n3. **1\u2011year / 60\u2011day claim deadline (Builder)** \u2013 365 or 60 days  \n   -

**Length:** 180 days from filing of dispute with Administrator.[9][10][11]  \n   - **Purpose:** Target to conclude arbitration efficiently; arbitrator may sanction delays.[9][10][11]\n\n6. **90\u2011day labor warranty (Purchase Contract)** \u2013 90 days  \n   - **Length:** 90 days.[2][6]  \n   - **Purpose:** Warranty on contractor\u2019s labor/workmanship.[2][6]\n\n7. **3\u2011business\u2011day cancellation right (Purchase Contract)** \u2013 3 business days  \n   - **Length:** 3 business days.[2][6]  \n   - **Purpose:** Cooling\u2011off period for customer to cancel and receive full refund.[2][6]\n\n8. **60\u2011day termination notice (Property Management Agreement)** \u2013 60 days  \n   - **Length:** 60 days.[5]  \n   - **Purpose:** Advance notice required to terminate the management agreement.[5]\n\n9. **5\u2011business\u2011day listing notice (Property Management Agreement)** \u2013 5 business days  \n   -

**Length:** More than 180 days.[7][8]  \n    - **Purpose:** Defines long\u2011term leases for commission and management purposes.[7][8]\n\n12. **10\u2011business\u2011day filing window (Holding Tank Contract)** \u2013 10 business days  \n    - **Length:** 10 business days.[14]  \n    - **Purpose:** Time allowed to file contract changes with municipality and County.[14]\n\n---\n\n### Q5: How does each day\u2011based window differ from the others in length and purpose?\n\nComparative characterization:\n\n- **Very short windows (3\u20135 business days):**  \n  - 3 business days \u2013 customer cancellation right for full refund (consumer protection).[2][6]  \n  - 5 business days \u2013 owner\u2019s notice to agent of listing agreement (information/coordination).[5]  \n  - These are **immediate, front\u2011end** or **notification** windows.\n\n- **Short operational windows (10\u201360 days):**  \n  - 10 business days \u2013 filing changes to holding tank contract (regulatory compliance).[14]  \n  - 60 days \u2013 builder\u2019s minor\u2011item warranty coverage and claim deadline (post\u2011completion quality assurance).[12][3]  \n  - 60 days \u2013 arbitration\u2011demand window (procedural choice of forum).[1]  \n  - 60 days \u2013 termination notice for property management agreement (exit planning).[5]  \n  - These are **short\u2011term operational or procedural** windows, often tied to notice, compliance, or minor warranty coverage.\n\n- **Medium windows (90\u2013180 days):**  \n  - 90 days \u2013 contractor labor warranty (post\u2011installation workmanship protection).[2][6]  \n  - 180 days \u2013 target to conclude arbitration (dispute resolution efficiency).[9][10][11]  \n  - 180\u2011day threshold \u2013 distinguishes short\u2011term vs. long\u2011term rentals (classification and fee structure).[7][8]  \n  - These are **medium\u2011term protection or classification** periods.\n\n- **Long windows (1 year):**  \n  - 1 year \u2013 builder\u2019s major\u2011system warranty and claim deadline (long\u2011term structural protection).[12][3]  \n  - 12\u2011month initial term of property management agreement (overall relationship duration, though expressed in months).[5]  \n  - These are **long\u2011term relationship or protection** periods.\n\nEach window is tailored to its function:\n\n- **Warranties** (60 days, 90 days, 1 year) protect against defects for defined periods.[12][2][6]  \n- **Procedural/dispute windows** (60\u2011day arbitration demand, 180\u2011day arbitration completion) govern how and how quickly disputes are handled.[1][9][10][11]  \n- **Contractual rights/termination** (3\u2011day cancellation, 60\u2011day termination notice) govern entry/exit from agreements.[2][6][5]  \n- **Regulatory/administrative** (10\u2011day filing, 5\u2011day listing notice) ensure timely communication with authorities or counterparties.[14][5]  \n- **Classification thresholds** (<180 days, >180 days) determine fee structures and rental categories.[7][8]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty vs. Purchase Contract:**  \n  - Both use **short warranties** (60 days vs. 90 days) for less critical items (minor components vs. labor) and **longer warranties** (1 year) for major systems in the builder\u2019s case.[12][2][6]  \n  - Both impose **time\u2011bound procedural requirements** (claim deadlines, arbitration windows, cancellation rights).[3][1][9][10][11][2][6]\n\n- **Property Management Agreement vs. others:**  \n  - Uses **60\u2011day** and **5\u2011day** windows for notice and coordination, similar in length to the builder\u2019s 60\u2011day windows but for different purposes (termination and listing notice vs. warranty and arbitration).[5][12][1]  \n  - Introduces **180\u2011day thresholds** to classify rentals, conceptually parallel to the builder\u2019s 180\u2011day arbitration target as a medium\u2011term benchmark.[7][8][9][10][11]\n\n- **Holding Tank Contract:**  \n  - Its **10\u2011business\u2011day** filing window is another short compliance period, analogous in length and function to the 5\u2011day and 3\u2011day notice/cancellation windows in other contracts, but aimed at regulatory filing rather than private notice.[14][5][2][6]\n\nOverall, the documents consistently use day\u2011based windows to:\n\n- Limit **warranty exposure** (60, 90, 365 days).  \n- Control **procedural steps** in disputes (60, 180 days).  \n- Define **entry/exit rights** (3 business days, 60 days).  \n- Ensure **timely communication/compliance** (5, 10 business days).  \n- Classify **transaction types** (less than / more than 180 days).\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the provided contracts, the explicit day\u2011based time windows include: 3, 5, 10 business days; 60, 90, 180 days; and thresholds at less than or more than 180 days, plus 1\u2011year periods paired with 60\u2011day language.[12][3][1][9][10][11][2][6][5][7][8][14] These windows differ in length from a few business days to a full year and serve distinct purposes: short windows for cancellation and notices, medium windows for labor warranties, arbitration, and classification, and longer windows for structural warranties and overall contractual relationships. Together, they define the temporal boundaries for rights, obligations, and procedures across the entire set of documents.",

ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [56], [57], [63], [64], [66], [69], [71], [74]\n\nKey points:\n\n1. **Fixed time limits from the start date**  \n   - Some coverages last **one year** from the coverage start (e.g., structural components, plumbing, heating, wiring, roof) [10], [22], [32], [37], [56], [57], [63], [66], [68], [71], [74].  \n   - Other specified items (doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, certain caulking) are covered for **sixty (60) days** from the coverage start [10], [22], [32], [37], [56], [57], [63], [66], [68], [71], [74].  \n   After those respective periods (1 year or 60 days from commencement), coverage for those items ends.\n\n2. **Written claim requirement before the period expires**  \n   - Claims must be made **in writing** before the applicable period ends; otherwise they are not covered:  \n     > \u201cANY AND ALL CLAIMS NOT MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN PRIOR TO ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) DAY WARRANTY PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE\u201d are excluded [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [56], [57], [63], [64], [66], [69], [71], [74].  \n   - The notification section reiterates that the Buyer/Owner must write a letter describing the defect and send it by certified mail before the end of the applicable warranty period [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [56], [57], [63], [64], [66], [69], [71], [74].\n\n3. **Automatic termination if the home is sold or the owner moves out**  \n   The warranty is non\u2011transferable:\n\n   > \u201cThis limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is **not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates**.\u201d [10], [22], [32], [37], [56], [57], [63], [66], [71], [74]\n\n   So, even if the one\u2011year or 60\u2011day period has not fully run, coverage ends immediately when:\n   - The first purchaser sells the home, or  \n   - The first purchaser moves out.\n\n4. **Practical condition for emergency defects**  \n   For emergencies, the owner must promptly notify the builder by phone; failure to promptly notify for an emergency \u201crelieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages\u201d [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [56], [57], [63], [64], [66], [69], [71], [74]. While this is framed as a condition on liability rather than a separate \u201cend date,\u201d in practice it can cut off coverage for that emergency defect if prompt notice is not given.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Start vs. end is tied to the same \u201ccommencement\u201d point.**  \n  Coverage start is defined by a specific event (earlier of final settlement or first occupancy) [10], [19], [69]. The end-of-coverage time limits (one year or 60 days) are measured from that same commencement date [10], [19], [69].\n\n- **Different components, different durations.**  \n  The warranty distinguishes between major systems/structure (1 year) and certain finish items (60 days) [10], [22], [68], [71]. Both sets use the same start trigger but have different end triggers in terms of time.\n\n- **Ownership status is an independent termination trigger.**  \n  Even if the time period has not expired, selling the home or moving out by the first purchaser automatically ends the warranty [10], [22], [32], [37], [56], [63], [66], [71], [74]. This is separate from the time-based expiration.\n\n- **Procedural requirements (written notice) are necessary to keep a claim within coverage.**  \n  The requirement that claims be made in writing before the applicable period ends [10], [19], [69] effectively means that coverage ends, for purposes of any given defect, if that written notice is not sent in time.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this Builders Limited Warranty, coverage begins on the earlier of (a) the date of final settlement or (b) the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home [10], [19], [69]. From that commencement date, different parts of the home are covered for either one year or sixty days, and coverage for each category ends when its respective period (one year or 60 days) has elapsed, unless otherwise provided [10], [22], [68], [69], [71], [74]. Additionally, the warranty automatically terminates in full if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, regardless of how much time remains [10], [22], [32], [37], [56], [63], [66], [71], [74]. For any defect to be covered, the owner must submit a written claim before the applicable one\u2011year or 60\u2011day period expires; claims not made in writing within those time limits are excluded from coverage [10], [19], [34], [69].",

          "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1. How \u201ccoverage start\u201d is defined (when warranty coverage begins)\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty defines the start of coverage in the \u201cTerm\u201d section:\n\n- Coverage begins on **\u201cthe date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first.\u201d** [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\nThis means there are two possible trigger events, and the earlier of the two is the coverage start:\n\n1. **Date of final settlement** (e.g., closing/financial settlement of the home purchase), or  \n2. **Date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**.\n\nWhichever of these happens first is the effective commencement date of all warranty coverages under this Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty. The warranty does not use the phrase \u201ccoverage start\u201d explicitly, but this \u201cbegin on\u201d language in \u00a72.A is the operative definition of when coverage starts. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\n### Q2. What must happen before coverage ends (end-of-coverage triggers)\n\nThe warranty describes two main types of end-of-coverage triggers:\n\n#### 1. Time\u2011based expiration of the warranty term\n\nThe warranty has different durations for different items (one year vs. sixty days), and it ties the end of coverage to a fixed period after the commencement date:\n\n- \u201cExcept as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate **one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\nThe specific coverages are:\n\n- **One\u2011year coverage** for structural components, plumbing (including septic tank if installed by Builder), heating, electric wiring systems, and roof. [10], [22], [32], [37], [59], [63], [71], [74], [78], [79], [80]\n- **Sixty\u2011day coverage** for doors (and hardware), windows, electric switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking around exterior openings, plumbing fixtures, and cabinet work. [10], [22], [32], [37], [59], [63], [71], [74], [78], [79], [80]\n\nThus, for each covered item, coverage ends automatically when its applicable period (one year or sixty days) has elapsed after the coverage start date defined in \u00a72.A. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\nAdditionally, the warranty states that **claims must be made in writing within those periods**, or they are not covered:\n\n- \u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\nSo, for coverage to apply:\n\n1. The defect must arise within the applicable warranty period (1 year or 60 days after commencement), and  \n2. The Buyer/Owner must **submit a written claim** before that period ends, following the notification procedure in \u00a76 (letter sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the Builder\u2019s address). [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\nIf the time period expires without a proper written claim, coverage for that defect ends, even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\n#### 2. Transfer/occupancy\u2011based termination (non\u2011transferability)\n\nThe warranty also ends if the original Buyer/Owner sells or moves out of the home:\n\n- \u201cThis limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is **not transferable**. **In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.**\u201d [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\nSo, even if the one\u2011year or sixty\u2011day period has not yet run, coverage ends immediately when:\n\n- The first purchaser **sells the home**, or  \n- The first purchaser **moves out** of the home.\n\nAfter that point, no further claims can be made under this warranty, regardless of time remaining. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\n#### 3. Practical/implicit conditions related to coverage ending\n\nWhile not additional \u201ctriggers,\u201d several provisions effectively limit coverage and thus define what must be done before coverage ends for a particular issue:\n\n- **Written notice requirement:** As noted, the Buyer/Owner must send written notice of the defect by certified mail before the applicable period ends. Failure to do so means the claim is \u201cnot covered.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n- **Emergency notification:** For emergencies, the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately; failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency \u201crelieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.\u201d [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n- **Exclusions and non\u2011warrantable conditions:** A long list of exclusions (e.g., wear and tear, acts of God, defects in owner\u2011installed items, etc.) are never covered, regardless of timing. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\nThese do not change the formal end date of the warranty term, but they define circumstances where coverage for a particular defect effectively ends or never applies.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **start of coverage** is anchored to a real\u2011world event tied to possession/closing: final settlement or first occupancy, whichever occurs first. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n- From that start date, **fixed time periods** (one year or sixty days) define when coverage **expires**, unless it ends earlier due to sale or move\u2011out. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n- The **non\u2011transferability clause** overlays a second dimension: coverage is tied to the first purchaser\u2019s ownership and occupancy; selling or moving out terminates the warranty even if the time period is still running. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n- The **written\u2011claim requirement** connects the time limits to actual use of the warranty: to benefit from coverage before it ends, the Buyer/Owner must submit a written claim within the applicable period. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]\n\nTogether, these provisions define a clear lifecycle: coverage starts at settlement/occupancy, runs for defined periods, and can end earlier if the original owner sells or moves out or fails to make timely written claims.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this Builders Limited Warranty, coverage begins on the **earlier of** (a) the date of final settlement or (b) the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82] Coverage then continues for **one year** for major structural and system components and **sixty days** for specified finish items, measured from that commencement date, provided that any claims are made in writing within those periods. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82] Coverage ends when the applicable one\u2011year or sixty\u2011day term expires, or **earlier** if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, at which point the warranty automatically terminates and is not transferable to subsequent owners. [10], [19], [22], [32], [34], [37], [39], [41], [44], [49], [59], [60], [61], [62], [63], [64], [65], [66], [72], [80], [82]",

          "response": "## Analysis\n\n### 1. Which documents contain percentage\u2011based fees?\n\nOnly the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** contains clearly percentage\u2011based fees:\n\n- 25% of gross revenues for short\u2011term/vacation rentals [13]  \n- 10% of gross revenues for long\u2011term leases [13]  \n- 10% fee on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations [13]  \n- Hawaii Gross Excise tax of 4.712% on all the above fees/commissions/charges [13]\n\nThese are all expressed as percentages of some underlying amount (gross revenues or total charges), so they are percentage\u2011based fees.\n\nNo other document in the corpus specifies any fee as a percentage of an amount.\n\n### 2. Which documents contain flat fees?\n\nA flat fee is a fixed dollar amount not tied to a percentage.\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n- Advertising charge: $75.00/month [13]  \n- Administration/accounting minimum charge: $50.00/month [13]  \n- Hourly charge: $35/hour for scheduling/escorting contractors [13]  \n- Agency start\u2011up fee: $250.00, non\u2011refundable [13]\n\nAll of these are fixed dollar amounts, so they are flat fees.\n\n**BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**  \n- Each party pays one\u2011half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration [1][2][3].  \n  While the total arbitration cost is variable, the obligation is expressed as a fixed fraction (\u00bd) of whatever that cost is, not as a percentage of contract price or revenues. It is not a flat dollar fee, but it is also not a percentage\u2011of\u2011price fee; it\u2019s a cost\u2011sharing rule. There are no explicit dollar\u2011amount \u201cfees\u201d in this document.\n\n**HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**  \n- The owner agrees \u201cto pay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon\u201d [12].  \n  This acknowledges charges/fees but does not specify any fixed dollar amount or percentage, so no explicit flat fee is defined.\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT**  \n- The contract sets a total contract price of $29,900.00, payable in three fixed installments: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion [4][5].  \n  These are fixed payment amounts, but they are the contract price installments, not described as \u201cfees.\u201d  \n- No separate \u201cfee\u201d line items (e.g., service fee, admin fee) are specified.\n\n**contoso_lifts_invoice**  \n- Lists fixed unit prices for each item (e.g., $11,200.00 for the lift, $3,000.00 for operation parts, etc.) [9].  \n  Again, these are prices for goods/services, not labeled as fees.\n\nSo, in terms of explicit *fee* language, the clearest flat fees are in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (monthly charges, hourly rate, start\u2011up fee) [13].\n\n### 3. Which documents contain deposits?\n\nA deposit is a payment made up front, often forfeitable on cancellation.\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT**  \n- Payment terms: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion [4][5].  \n- \u201cRight to Cancel\u201d: \u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d [4][5]  \n  This explicitly calls the initial payment a **deposit** and states it is forfeited if cancellation occurs after 3 business days. Thus, this contract clearly includes a deposit concept.\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n- \u201cAGENCY START\u2011UP FEE. Upon the execution of this Agreement, the Owner shall pay two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the Agent as a non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee.\u201d [13]  \n  Functionally, this is an upfront, non\u2011refundable payment, similar to a deposit, but it is explicitly labeled a \u201cstart\u2011up fee,\u201d not \u201cdeposit.\u201d It is best categorized as a flat, non\u2011refundable fee rather than a deposit.\n\n**Other documents**  \n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**, **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**, and **contoso_lifts_invoice** do not mention any \u201cdeposit\u201d or clearly deposit\u2011like upfront payment in the provided text [1][2][3][6][7][8][9][12][15][16].\n\n### 4. How do these \u201cfees\u201d concepts compare across the documents?\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n  - Has the richest fee structure: multiple percentage\u2011based commissions (25%, 10%, 10%) and a percentage tax (4.712%) [13].  \n  - Also has several flat fees: $75/month advertising, $50/month admin, $35/hour scheduling, $250 non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee [13].  \n  - Fees are ongoing and tied to revenue, services, and time.\n\n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**  \n  - No percentage\u2011based fees.  \n  - Uses fixed installment amounts as the contract price, and explicitly treats the initial payment as a **deposit** that is refundable only within 3 business days; after that, it is forfeited [4][5].  \n  - The \u201cfee\u201d concept here is mainly the deposit and legal fees recoverable on default (\u201cLegal fees are recoverable by Contractor\u201d [4][5]), but those legal fees are not quantified as flat or percentage\u2011based.\n\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**  \n  - No percentage\u2011of\u2011price fees or deposits.  \n  - Cost\u2011sharing rule: each party pays one\u2011half of arbitration costs and fees [1][2][3]. This is a proportional split of actual arbitration costs, not a fee based on contract value or revenues.\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**  \n  - Acknowledges that the owner will pay \u201ccharges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon\u201d [12], but does not specify whether those charges are flat or percentage\u2011based, nor any deposit.\n\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**  \n  - Lists item prices and a total amount due [9].  \n  - No explicit \u201cfees\u201d (e.g., service fee, admin fee) and no deposit language.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Percentage\u2011based vs flat fees**  \n  - Only the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** uses percentage\u2011based fees (commissions and tax) [13].  \n  - It also uses multiple flat fees (monthly charges, hourly rate, start\u2011up fee) [13].  \n  - Other documents either have fixed prices/payments (purchase contract, invoice) [4][5][9] or unspecified \u201ccharges\u201d (holding tank contract) [12], but not explicit percentage\u2011based fees.\n\n- **Deposits vs other upfront payments**  \n  - The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** clearly defines a deposit that is refundable for 3 days and then forfeitable [4][5].  \n  - The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** has a non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee that functions similarly to an upfront, sunk cost but is not called a deposit [13].  \n  - The other documents do not mention deposits.\n\n- **Nature of \u201cfees\u201d across documents**  \n  - **Property management**: fee\u2011heavy, with both percentage and flat structures, plus tax [13].  \n  - **Purchase/installation**: focuses on contract price installments and a deposit, not ongoing fees [4][5].  \n  - **Warranty and service contracts**: focus on obligations and cost\u2011sharing (\u00bd arbitration costs; mutually agreed service charges) rather than defined fee schedules [1][2][3][12].  \n  - **Invoice**: pure pricing, no separate fee constructs [9].\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Percentage\u2011based fees**:  \n  - Present only in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (25% and 10% commissions, 10% on repairs, 4.712% tax) [13].\n\n- **Flat fees**:  \n  - Clearly present in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** ($75/month advertising, $50/month admin, $35/hour, $250 start\u2011up fee) [13].  \n  - Other documents have fixed prices or cost splits but not explicit flat \u201cfees\u201d in the same sense.\n\n- **Deposits**:  \n  - Explicitly present in the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**, where the initial payment is treated as a deposit that is fully refundable for 3 business days and forfeited thereafter [4][5].  \n  - No other document explicitly labels any payment as a deposit; the property management start\u2011up fee is upfront and non\u2011refundable but is framed as a fee, not a deposit [13].\n\nThus, across the corpus:  \n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**: both percentage\u2011based and flat fees, plus an upfront non\u2011refundable fee.  \n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**: no percentage\u2011based fees, but includes a deposit.  \n- Other documents: no explicit percentage\u2011based fees or deposits, and only limited or implicit fee/charge concepts.",

All monetary amounts are fixed dollar installments ($20,000, $7,000, $2,900) toward a total contract price of $29,900.00.[4][5]\n\n**HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**\n\n- No fees are quantified as percentages. The owner agrees \u201cto pay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon,\u201d but no percentage formula is given.[12]\n\n**contoso_lifts_invoice**\n\n- No percentage-based fees. The invoice lists unit prices and totals for each line item and a subtotal of $29,900.00, with tax listed as \u201cN/A.\u201d[9]\n\n**BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**\n\n- No percentage-based fees. The only \u201cfees\u201d reference is that \u201cEach party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration,\u201d which is a 50/50 cost split, not a fee calculated as a percentage of some transaction amount.[1][2][3]\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\nThis document has multiple explicit percentage-based fees:\n\n- 25% commission on gross revenues for short-term/vacation rentals: \u201cA fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).\u201d[13][14][17]  \n  - Calculated as 25% of gross rental revenues for stays under 180 days.\n\n- 10% commission on gross revenues for long-term leases: \u201cA fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).\u201d[13][14][17]  \n  - Calculated as 10% of gross rental revenues for leases over 180 days.\n\n- 10% fee on repairs/upgrades/renovations: \u201cA fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.\u201d[13][14][17]  \n  - Calculated as 10% of the total cost of those work items.\n\n- Hawaii Gross Excise tax percentage: \u201cthe Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.\u201d[13][14][17]  \n  - Calculated as 4.712% of the sum of all the listed fees/commissions/charges.\n\nThus, **only the Property Management Agreement** defines percentage-based fees, and they are applied as percentages of gross revenues, repair costs, and total fees/charges.[13][14][17]\n\n---\n\n### Q2 & Q5 \u2013 Flat fees and conditions under which they are charged\n\n**purchase_contract**\n\n- The payment terms are fixed dollar amounts, but they function as installment payments of the contract price rather than \u201cfees\u201d in the sense of service or administrative fees:\n  - Total contract price: $29,900.00.[4][5]\n  - Installments: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion.[4][5]\n- These are not labeled as \u201cfees\u201d and are consideration for the lift and installation, not separate fee concepts.\n\n**HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**\n\n- No flat fee amounts are specified. Payment is \u201ccharges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon,\u201d with no fixed dollar schedule.[12]\n\n**contoso_lifts_invoice**\n\n- Lists fixed prices per item (e.g., $11,200.00 for the lift, $3,000.00 for operation parts, etc.) and a subtotal of $29,900.00.[9]  \n- These are sales prices, not described as separate \u201cfees.\u201d\n\n**BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**\n\n- No explicit flat \u201cfees\u201d are charged to the consumer. The only cost allocation is that each party pays half of arbitration costs and their own attorneys\u2019 fees.[1][2][3]  \n- This is a cost-sharing rule, not a fixed fee schedule.\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\nThis document has several explicit flat fees and charges, with clear conditions:\n\n- Advertising charge: \u201cA pro-ration charge for advertising for short-term (vacation rentals), at $75.00/month.\u201d[13][14][17]  \n  - Flat $75 per month, charged for advertising short-term/vacation rentals.\n\n- Administration and accounting charge: \u201cA minimum charge for administration and accounting, at $50.00/month (not to include tax preparation/returns/forms).\u201d[13][14][17]  \n  - Flat $50 per month minimum, for admin and accounting services.\n\n- Hourly charge for coordination: \u201cA charge of $35/hour to schedule repairs, upgrades, renovations, replacement of appliances, carpets, curtains, drapes, and/or to escort the contractors, repair persons, technicians and handymen.\u201d[13][14][17]  \n  - Flat hourly rate of $35, triggered when the agent performs scheduling/escort tasks for repairs or similar work.\n\n- Agency start-up fee: \u201cUpon the execution of this Agreement, the Owner shall pay two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the Agent as a non-refundable start-up fee.\u201d[13][14][17]  \n  - One-time $250 flat fee, due at execution of the agreement, used for initial administrative expenses, inventory, and inspection.[13][14][17]\n\nConditions summary for these flat fees:\n\n- Monthly advertising and admin/accounting charges apply during the term of the management relationship, tied to ongoing management of the property.[17]\n- The $35/hour charge applies when the agent is actively coordinating or escorting service providers.[13][14][17]\n- The $250 start-up fee is due once, at execution, and is non-refundable.[13][14][17]\n\nThus, **only the Property Management Agreement** clearly defines flat \u201cfees\u201d with explicit dollar amounts and conditions.\n\n---\n\n### Q3 \u2013 Deposits and their terms/conditions\n\n**purchase_contract**\n\n- The contract uses the term \u201cinitial payment\u201d and \u201cdeposit\u201d in the cancellation clause:\n  - Payment terms: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion.[4][5]\n  - Right to cancel: \u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d[4][5]\n- The document does not explicitly label which installment is the \u201cdeposit,\u201d but:\n  - The contract is \u201ceffective upon mutual signature and initial payment,\u201d[4][5] and the first installment is $20,000 upon signing.[4][5]\n  - The cancellation clause refers to \u201cdeposit\u201d being forfeited after 3 business days.[4][5]\n- Reasonable reading: the initial payment (the $20,000 due upon signing) functions as a **deposit**:\n  - Terms: If the customer cancels within 3 business days, they receive a full refund of the deposit; after that period, the deposit is forfeited to the contractor.[4][5]\n\n**HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**\n\n- No deposit is mentioned. Payment is for \u201ccharges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon,\u201d with no advance deposit language.[12]\n\n**contoso_lifts_invoice**\n\n- No deposit is mentioned. The invoice is for \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d[9] but does not itself define a deposit or its conditions.\n\n**BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**\n\n- No deposit is referenced. The document is a warranty and arbitration agreement, not a sales contract with deposits.[6][7][8][15][16]\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\n- No \u201cdeposit\u201d is explicitly defined as such. The $250 start-up fee is a non-refundable fee, not described as a deposit.[13][14][17]  \n- Security deposits from tenants are not discussed in the provided excerpt.\n\nThus, **only the Purchase Contract** clearly involves a deposit concept, via the initial payment that is refundable for 3 days and then forfeitable.[4][5]\n\n---\n\n### Q4 & Q6 \u2013 Which documents include percentage-based fees, flat fees, and deposits, and comparison across documents\n\n#### Which documents include percentage-based fees?\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** \u2013 Yes:\n  - 25% of gross revenues (short-term rentals).[13][14][17]\n  - 10% of gross revenues (long-term leases).[13][14][17]\n  - 10% of total charges for repairs/upgrades/renovations.[13][14][17]\n  - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all above fees/commissions/charges.[13][14][17]\n\n- **All other documents (purchase_contract, HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT, contoso_lifts_invoice, BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY)** \u2013 No percentage-based fee structures are defined.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][12][15][16]\n\n#### Which documents include flat fees?\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** \u2013 Yes:\n  - $75/month advertising charge for short-term rentals.[13][14][17]\n  - $50/month minimum administration and accounting charge.[13][14][17]\n  - $35/hour coordination/escort charge.[13][14][17]\n  - $250 non-refundable agency start-up fee at execution.[13][14][17]\n\n- **purchase_contract** \u2013 Contains fixed dollar amounts for contract price installments ($20,000, $7,000, $2,900), but these are payments for the product/service, not labeled as separate \u201cfees.\u201d[4][5]\n\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice** \u2013 Lists fixed prices per item and a total, but again these are sales prices, not separate fee concepts.[9]\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** \u2013 No specific flat fee amounts; charges are \u201cas mutually agreed upon.\u201d[12]\n\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY** \u2013 No flat \u201cfees\u201d charged; only a 50/50 split of arbitration costs.[1][2][3]\n\nIn terms of explicit \u201cfee\u201d structures, **only the Property Management Agreement** clearly defines flat fees as such.\n\n#### Which documents include deposits?\n\n- **purchase_contract** \u2013 Yes:\n  - Initial payment (likely the $20,000 upon signing) functions as a deposit, refundable if the customer cancels within 3 business days, and forfeited thereafter.[4][5]\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** \u2013 No deposit.[12]\n\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice** \u2013 No deposit defined; references \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d but no deposit terms.[9]\n\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY** \u2013 No deposit.[6][7][8][15][16]\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** \u2013 No deposit explicitly defined; the $250 start-up fee is non-refundable and described as a fee, not a deposit.[13][14][17]\n\n#### Comparison of how these structures are defined, calculated, and applied\n\n- **Percentage-based fees (Property Management Agreement)**:\n  - Defined as commissions or fees tied to revenue or cost bases (gross rental revenues; total repair/upgrade charges).[13][14][17]\n  - Applied automatically as a percentage of those bases, with conditions based on rental term (short vs. long term) or type of expense (repairs/upgrades).[13][14][17]\n  - Additional tax percentage (4.712%) is applied on top of all such fees/commissions/charges.[13][14][17]\n\n- **Flat fees (Property Management Agreement)**:\n  - Defined as fixed dollar amounts per month, per hour, or one-time at execution.[13][14][17]\n  - Charged based on time (monthly), activity (hourly coordination), or event (execution of agreement).[13][14][17]\n\n- **Deposit (Purchase Contract)**:\n  - Defined implicitly via \u201cinitial payment\u201d and \u201cdeposit is forfeited\u201d language.[4][5]\n  - Applied as an upfront payment that secures the contract; fully refundable if the customer cancels within 3 business days, non-refundable thereafter.[4][5]\n  - Not calculated as a percentage; it is a fixed dollar amount (the first installment).[4][5]\n\n- **Other documents**:\n  - HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT and BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY do not structure fees as percentages, flat fee schedules, or deposits; they either leave charges to mutual agreement or allocate costs (e.g., arbitration) without defining fee schedules.[1][2][3][6][7][8][12][15][16]\n  - contoso_lifts_invoice is a price breakdown, not a fee/deposit structure.[9]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Only one document with percentage-based fees**: The Property Management Agreement is unique in using multiple percentage-based fee structures (commissions, repair fee, tax) tied to revenue and cost bases.[13][14][17]\n\n- **Only one document with a clear deposit**: The Purchase Contract is the only document that clearly treats an upfront payment as a deposit with specific refund/forfeiture conditions.[4][5]\n\n- **Only one document with explicit fee schedule (flat + percentage)**: Again, the Property Management Agreement stands out with a detailed fee schedule combining flat monthly/hourly/one-time fees and percentage-based commissions and surcharges.[13][14][17]\n\n- **Other documents focus on prices or cost-sharing, not \u201cfees\u201d**:\n  - The invoice and purchase contract list prices and installments, but not separate fee concepts.\n  - The holding tank contract and warranty allocate responsibilities and costs but do not define fee schedules or deposits.[1][2][3][6][7][8][9][12][15][16]\n\nThese connections show that the \u201cfees\u201d concept is most fully developed in the Property Management Agreement, while the \u201cdeposit\u201d concept is specific to the Purchase Contract.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Percentage-based fees**:  \n  - Present only in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**, which charges:\n    - 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rentals.[13][14][17]  \n    - 10% of gross revenues for long-term leases.[13][14][17]  \n    - 10% of total charges for repairs/upgrades/renovations.[13][14][17]  \n    - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all such fees/commissions/charges.[13][14][17]\n\n- **Flat fees**:  \n  - Explicitly defined only in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:\n    - $75/month advertising charge.[13][14][17]  \n    - $50/month minimum admin/accounting charge.[13][14][17]  \n    - $35/hour coordination/escort charge.[13][14][17]  \n    - $250 non-refundable start-up fee at execution.[13][14][17]  \n  - Other documents have fixed prices or installments but do not label them as separate \u201cfees.\u201d\n\n- **Deposits**:  \n  - Clearly present only in the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**, where the initial payment (the $20,000 due upon signing) functions as a deposit that is fully refundable if the customer cancels within 3 business days and forfeited thereafter.[4][5]\n\nSo, comparing the \u201cfees\u201d concepts:\n\n- The **Property Management Agreement** is the only document with structured percentage-based and flat fee schedules.  \n- The **Purchase Contract** is the only document that clearly uses a **deposit** with defined refund/forfeiture conditions.  \n- The **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, **Contoso Lifts Invoice**, and **Builders Limited Warranty** do not define percentage-based fees, explicit flat fee schedules, or deposits in the way the question contemplates.[1][2][3][6][7][8][9][12][15][16]",

Customer holds risk thereafter.\u201d[9][12]  \n   - Location: PURCHASE CONTRACT, \u00a75 \u201cRisk of Loss\u201d.[9][12]\n\n2. **Hold Harmless / Indemnity \u2013 Property Management Agreement (Owner vs. Agent)**  \n   - Text: \u201cThe Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.\u201d[1][10][11]  \n   - Location: PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT, \u201cHOLD HARMLESS\u201d clause.[1][10][11]\n\n3. **Warranty Exclusions / Disclaimers \u2013 Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty (Builder vs. Buyer/Owner)**  \n   This appears as a cluster of provisions that together allocate risk away from the Builder and onto the Buyer/Owner:  \n   - Exclusions from coverage (e.g., no responsibility for consequential damages, acts of God, owner\u2019s negligence, etc.)[2][4][6]  \n   - Disclaimer of all other warranties (\u201cNo Other Warranties\u201d)[2][4][6]  \n   - Exclusion of bodily injury and non-home property damage[2][4][6]  \n\n   Key language:  \n   - \u201cThe Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.\u201d[2][4][6]  \n   - \u201cCONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES\u201d are excluded.[2][4][6]  \n   - \u201cBodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.\u201d is excluded.[2][4][6]  \n   - \u201cALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES\u2026 ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.\u201d[2][4][6]  \n   - Location: BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY, \u00a7\u00a74 \u201cExclusions from Coverage\u201d and 5 \u201cNo Other Warranties\u201d.[2][4][6]\n\nThese three are the clearest, discrete risk allocation mechanisms in the corpus.\n\n---\n\n### Q2 & Q6 \u2013 Specific allocation of risk/liability in each statement\n\n#### 1. Purchase Contract \u2013 Risk of Loss Clause\n\n- Allocation:  \n  - **Contractor** bears the risk of loss or damage to the lift **up to the point of delivery**.[9][12]  \n  - **Customer** bears the risk of loss or damage **from delivery onward**.[9][12]\n\n- Practical effect:  \n  - If the lift is damaged in transit or before it is delivered, the Contractor is responsible.  \n  - Once delivered (even if not yet installed or fully paid for), the Customer bears the risk of damage or loss.\n\n#### 2. Property Management Agreement \u2013 Hold Harmless / Indemnity\n\n- Allocation:  \n  - **Agent** (property manager) is **not liable** for \u201cany claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property,\u201d **except** where the loss is caused by the Agent\u2019s \u201cgross negligence or wilful misconduct.\u201d[1][10][11]  \n  - **Owner** bears essentially all other liability for such claims and must \u201chold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.\u201d[1][10][11]\n\n- Practical effect:  \n  - For ordinary negligence, accidents, or conditions on the property, the Owner is financially responsible.  \n  - The Agent is only exposed where its conduct rises to gross negligence or willful misconduct; even then, the clause does not require Owner to indemnify the Agent for those limited cases.\n\n#### 3. Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty \u2013 Exclusions and Disclaimers\n\n- Allocation:  \n  - **Builder** is responsible only for specifically defined defects in materials or workmanship within limited time periods (1 year for structural systems; 60 days for certain items).[2]  \n  - **Buyer/Owner** bears:\n    - All **consequential or incidental damages** (e.g., lost use, alternative housing, etc.), because they are expressly excluded.[2][4][6]  \n    - Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, non-residential use, and characteristics of materials (e.g., warping, cracking).[2][4][6]  \n    - Defects in items installed by the Owner or others not selected by the Builder.[2][4][6]  \n    - Loss or damage from insects, animals, fire, explosion, water escape, soil movement, storms, flood, earthquakes, and \u201cacts of God.\u201d[2][4][6]  \n    - Bodily injury and damage to personal property or to real property not part of the original home.[2][4][6]  \n    - Any claims not made in writing within the warranty period.[2][4][6]  \n  - Additionally, the Builder disclaims all implied warranties (merchantability, fitness, habitability, good workmanship, environmental pollutants).[2][4][6]\n\n- Practical effect:  \n  - The Builder\u2019s liability is narrowly confined to repairing or replacing certain defects within a short window.  \n  - The Owner bears almost all other risks associated with the home, including many that might otherwise fall on a builder under default law.\n\n---\n\n### Q3 & Q7 \u2013 How the wording shifts liability between the parties\n\n#### 1. Purchase Contract \u2013 \u201cContractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.\u201d[9][12]\n\n- Mechanism:  \n  - The clause uses a clear temporal trigger\u2014\u201cuntil delivery\u201d vs. \u201cthereafter\u201d\u2014to shift risk at a specific moment.  \n  - It does not qualify the shift by cause (e.g., negligence vs. accident); the shift is **time-based**, not **fault-based**.\n\n- Liability shift:  \n  - Before delivery: Contractor is effectively self-insuring the goods.  \n  - After delivery: Customer must bear or insure against loss, even if the loss is not their fault (e.g., theft, fire after delivery but before installation).\n\n#### 2. Property Management Agreement \u2013 \u201cshall not be liable\u2026 except for\u2026 gross negligence or wilful misconduct\u2026 and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent\u201d[1][10][11]\n\n- Mechanism:  \n  - **Exculpatory language**: \u201cshall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury\u2026\u201d creates a broad release of the Agent from liability.  \n  - **Exception**: \u201cexcept for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct\u201d carves out a narrow category where the Agent can still be liable.  \n  - **Indemnity language**: \u201cOwner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent\u201d obligates the Owner to reimburse the Agent for claims and costs (e.g., defense costs, settlements) for covered claims.[1][10][11]\n\n- Liability shift:  \n  - Default tort principles would often expose an agent to liability for its own negligence. This clause shifts that risk to the Owner for all but the most egregious conduct.  \n  - The Owner effectively becomes the financial backstop for most third-party claims arising on the property.\n\n#### 3. Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty \u2013 Exclusions and Disclaimers[2][4][6]\n\n- Mechanism:  \n  - **Enumerated exclusions**: \u201cThe Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded\u2026\u201d[2][4][6] lists specific categories of damage and circumstances, thereby carving them out of the Builder\u2019s responsibility.  \n  - **Capitalized disclaimer**: \u201cCONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES\u201d in all caps emphasizes that such damages are excluded, subject to state law.[2][4][6]  \n  - **Scope limitation**: Excluding \u201cbodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home\u201d[2][4][6] ensures the Builder\u2019s obligations are limited to the home itself, not broader tort-type damages.  \n  - **Global warranty disclaimer**: \u201cALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES\u2026 ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.\u201d[2][4][6] attempts to eliminate any non-express warranty obligations that might otherwise arise by law.\n\n- Liability shift:  \n  - Without these clauses, the Builder might face broader warranty and tort exposure (e.g., implied habitability, consequential damages from defects).  \n  - The wording shifts those risks to the Buyer/Owner by:\n    - Narrowing what counts as a covered \u201cdefect.\u201d  \n    - Limiting the remedy to repair/replace within a short period.  \n    - Excluding entire categories of damages and causes (acts of God, owner negligence, etc.).  \n    - Cutting off claims not timely made in writing.\n\n---\n\n### Q4 & Q8 \u2013 Comparing how each clause shifts liability and the differences in risk allocation\n\n1. **Trigger and structure of the risk shift**\n\n   - **Purchase Contract \u2013 Risk of Loss**:  \n     - Trigger: **Time/event-based** (delivery).  \n     - Once delivery occurs, risk shifts automatically, regardless of fault.[9][12]\n\n   - **Property Management \u2013 Hold Harmless**:  \n     - Trigger: **Cause-based** (who caused the loss and what level of fault).  \n     - Agent is protected for ordinary negligence; only gross negligence or willful misconduct remains with Agent.[1][10][11]\n\n   - **Builder\u2019s Warranty \u2013 Exclusions/Disclaimers**:  \n     - Trigger: **Category-based** (type of damage, cause, and timing).  \n     - If the loss falls into an excluded category (e.g., consequential damages, acts of God, owner negligence, late claim), it is automatically the Owner\u2019s risk.[2][4][6]\n\n2. **Which party ends up bearing more risk**\n\n   - **Purchase Contract**:  \n     - Risk is relatively balanced in time: Contractor bears pre-delivery risk; Customer bears post-delivery risk.[9][12]  \n     - The shift is clear and limited to the goods themselves.\n\n   - **Property Management Agreement**:  \n     - Owner bears **most** risk for injuries and property damage on the premises, including claims that might be caused by the Agent\u2019s ordinary negligence.[1][10][11]  \n     - Agent\u2019s exposure is narrowed to only gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\n   - **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty**:  \n     - Buyer/Owner bears **very broad** risk: many types of damage, many causes, and all consequential damages are excluded.[2][4][6]  \n     - Builder\u2019s risk is confined to a narrow band of defects and a short time frame.\n\n3. **Extent, type, and likelihood of liability**\n\n   - **Purchase Contract**:  \n     - Type: Physical loss or damage to the lift.  \n     - Extent: Limited to the value of the goods; no explicit mention of consequential damages in this clause.  \n     - Likelihood: Predictable; depends on when loss occurs relative to delivery.\n\n   - **Property Management Agreement**:  \n     - Type: Third-party claims for bodily injury or property damage on the rental property.[1][10][11]  \n     - Extent: Potentially large (personal injury claims), but shifted to Owner via indemnity.  \n     - Likelihood: Higher for Owner, because Owner is the primary target for premises liability and must also protect Agent.\n\n   - **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty**:  \n     - Type: Construction defects and related damages.  \n     - Extent: Builder\u2019s liability is limited to repair/replace of certain defects; Owner bears consequential damages, environmental risks, many external events, and bodily injury/property damage.[2][4][6]  \n     - Likelihood: Many common issues (e.g., minor cracking, weather-related damage, late-discovered defects) fall on Owner, increasing Owner\u2019s overall risk.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- All three clauses **reallocate risk away from the service provider** (Contractor, Agent, Builder) and toward the customer/owner, but they do so using different mechanisms:\n  - **Temporal allocation** (risk of loss at delivery) in the Purchase Contract.[9][12]\n  - **Fault-level and indemnity allocation** (ordinary vs. gross negligence) in the Property Management Agreement.[1][10][11]\n  - **Category and scope allocation** (exclusions, disclaimers, time limits) in the Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty.[2][4][6]\n\n- The **Property Management Agreement** and **Builder\u2019s Warranty** both use **exclusionary language** (\u201cshall not be liable,\u201d \u201cdoes not assume responsibility,\u201d \u201care hereby disclaimed\u201d) to narrow the provider\u2019s obligations and expand the owner\u2019s risk.[1][10][11][2][4][6]\n\n- The **Purchase Contract** is comparatively simple and narrow: it only addresses who bears the risk of loss to the goods and when that risk changes hands.[9][12] The other two instruments address broader categories of liability (third-party claims, consequential damages, acts of God, etc.).[1][10][11][2][4][6]\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe three \u201crisk allocation\u201d statements are:\n\n1. **Risk of Loss clause in the Purchase Contract** \u2013 allocates risk of damage to the lift to the Contractor before delivery and to the Customer after delivery, using a clear time-based shift.[9][12]\n\n2. **Hold Harmless / Indemnity clause in the Property Management Agreement** \u2013 shifts nearly all liability for loss or injury on the property to the Owner, requiring the Owner to indemnify the Agent, except where the Agent\u2019s conduct is grossly negligent or willful.[1][10][11]\n\n3. **Exclusions and Warranty Disclaimers in the Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty** \u2013 sharply limit the Builder\u2019s responsibility to narrow, time-limited defects and exclude consequential damages, many causes of loss, bodily injury, and implied warranties, thereby placing most remaining risks on the Buyer/Owner.[2][4][6]\n\nEach clause uses different drafting techniques\u2014temporal triggers, exculpatory and indemnity language, and detailed exclusions\u2014to shift liability and determine which party ultimately bears specific risks.",

To answer that, we need to (1) identify three distinct contractual clauses that allocate risk/liability, and (2) explain, for each, who bears which risk and how that differs from the default.\n\nAcross the provided documents, the clearest and most explicit risk\u2011allocation provisions are:\n\n1. A **risk of loss** clause in the Purchase Contract.  \n2. A **hold harmless / indemnity** clause in the Property Management Agreement.  \n3. A **warranty disclaimer and exclusions** set in the Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty.\n\nThese are three different mechanisms by which risk is allocated between parties.\n\n---\n\n### Q1 / Q5: What are the three different \u201crisk allocation\u201d statements, and how are they identified?\n\n1. **\u201cRisk of Loss\u201d clause \u2013 Purchase Contract**  \n   - Labeled as: \u201c### 5. Risk of Loss\u201d in the PURCHASE CONTRACT.[9][12]  \n   - Text (substance): \u201cContractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.\u201d[9][12]  \n   - This is a classic risk\u2011of\u2011loss allocation provision.\n\n2. **\u201cHold Harmless\u201d clause \u2013 Property Management Agreement**  \n   - Labeled as: \u201cHOLD HARMLESS.\u201d in the PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.[1][10][11]  \n   - Text (substance): Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury on the property, except for loss or injury caused by Agent\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.[1][10][11]  \n   - This is an indemnity / hold\u2011harmless risk\u2011allocation clause.\n\n3. **Warranty disclaimer and exclusions \u2013 Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty**  \n   - Identified by headings:  \n     - \u201c4.

No Other Warranties.\u201d[2][4][6]  \n   - Key language:  \n     - The Builder excludes responsibility for numerous categories of damage and loss (e.g., consequential or incidental damages, damage from wear and tear, acts of God, bodily injury, etc.).[2][4][6]  \n     - The Builder disclaims all other warranties, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, habitability, and good workmanship.[2][4][6]  \n   - Together, these provisions allocate a large portion of risk away from the Builder and onto the Buyer/Owner.\n\nThese three are distinctly labeled and operate in different ways, so they satisfy the request for three different \u201crisk allocation\u201d statements.\n\n---\n\n### Q2 / Q6: How does the first statement (Risk of Loss) shift liability, and between which parties?\n\n**Statement:** \u201c### 5. Risk of Loss \u2013 Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.\u201d[9][12]\n\n**Parties involved:**\n- Contractor: Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor).[9][12]  \n- Customer: Fabrikam Inc. (Customer).[9][12]\n\n**How it shifts liability:**\n\n- **Before delivery:**  \n  The Contractor bears the risk of loss or damage to the lift and related equipment. If the lift is damaged, destroyed, or lost before it is delivered, the Contractor is responsible for that loss (e.g., repair, replacement, or financial impact), not the Customer.[9][12]\n\n- **After delivery:**  \n  Once delivery occurs, the risk shifts to the Customer. From that point forward, if the lift is damaged, destroyed, or lost, the Customer bears that risk, even if the Customer has not yet completed all payments.[9][12]\n\n**Effect on default allocation:**\n\n- Without such a clause, risk of loss might be governed by default commercial law rules (e.g., UCC rules on shipment vs. destination contracts).  \n- This clause **explicitly reallocates** that risk by drawing a clear line at \u201cdelivery\u201d:  \n  - Pre\u2011delivery: risk on Contractor.  \n  - Post\u2011delivery: risk on Customer.[9][12]\n\n---\n\n### Q3 / Q7: How does the second statement (Hold Harmless) shift liability, and between which parties?\n\n**Statement:** \u201cHOLD HARMLESS\u201d clause in the Property Management Agreement.[1][10][11]\n\nKey language (substance):  \n- \u201cThe Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.\u201d[1][10][11]\n\n**Parties involved:**\n- Owner: Contoso Ltd. (Owner).[1]  \n- Agent: Walt Flood Realty (Agent).[1]\n\n**How it shifts liability:**\n\n- **General rule created by the clause:**  \n  - The Agent is **not liable** for claims for loss or injury to persons or property on the managed property, **except** where the loss or injury is caused by the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct.[1][10][11]  \n  - The Owner must **hold the Agent harmless and indemnify** the Agent for such claims or liabilities (i.e., the Owner must protect the Agent from having to pay and must reimburse the Agent if the Agent incurs such liability), again except where the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct is the cause.[1][10][11]\n\n- **Practical effect:**  \n  - For most ordinary negligence or premises\u2011liability claims (e.g., a guest slips and falls, property damage from a defect), the **Owner** bears the risk and financial responsibility, not the Agent.  \n  - The Agent only retains liability for its own **gross negligence or willful misconduct**, which is a much narrower category of fault.[1][10][11]\n\n**Effect on default allocation:**\n\n- Without this clause, both Owner and Agent could potentially face liability to third parties under general tort principles (e.g., an agent managing property might be liable for negligent maintenance).  \n- This clause **reallocates** that risk by:\n  - Shifting most third\u2011party loss/injury risk from the Agent to the Owner.  \n  - Requiring the Owner to indemnify the Agent for such claims, thereby contractually insulating the Agent from most liability.[1][10][11]\n\n---\n\n### Q4 / Q8: How does the third statement (Warranty exclusions/disclaimers) shift liability, and between which parties?\n\n**Statements:**  \n- \u201c4. Exclusions from Coverage.\u201d[2][4][6]  \n- \u201c5. No Other Warranties.\u201d[2][4][6]  \nin the BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY.\n\nKey elements:\n\n1. **Exclusions from Coverage** \u2013 the Builder \u201cdoes not assume responsibility\u201d for a long list of items, including:  \n   - Consequential or incidental damages.[2][4][6]  \n   - Defects covered by manufacturers\u2019 warranties.[2][4][6]  \n   - Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, non\u2011residential use.[2][4][6]  \n   - Defects due to inherent material characteristics (e.g., warping of wood, cracking of concrete).[2][4][6]  \n   - Work or materials installed by the Buyer/Owner or others.[2][4][6]  \n   - Loss or damage caused by insects, animals, fire, explosion, smoke, water escape, ground movement, windstorm, hail, lightning, falling trees, vehicles, flood, earthquakes, or acts of God.[2][4][6]  \n   - Bodily injury or damage to personal property or to real property not part of the original home as constructed by the Builder.[2][4][6]  \n   - Claims not made in writing within the warranty period, and damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification.[2][4][6]\n\n2. **No Other Warranties** \u2013 the Builder states that this express limited warranty is the only warranty provided, and that **all other warranties**, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, habitability, and good workmanship, and any warranty that might be construed to cover environmental pollutants, are **disclaimed**.[2][4][6]\n\n**Parties involved:**\n- Builder: Fabrikam Inc. (Builder).[2]  \n- Buyer/Owner: Contoso Ltd. (Buyer/Owner).[2]\n\n**How it shifts liability:**\n\n- **Narrowing the Builder\u2019s obligations:**  \n  - The Builder\u2019s responsibility is confined to the specific defects and time periods described in the limited warranty (e.g., one year for structural components and systems, sixty days for certain items).[2]  \n  - By excluding consequential and incidental damages, the Builder avoids liability for indirect losses (e.g., lost use, alternative housing costs) even if a covered defect exists.[2][4][6]\n\n- **Shifting many risks to the Buyer/Owner:**  \n  - The Buyer/Owner bears the risk of:\n    - Ordinary wear and tear and maintenance\u2011related issues.[2][4][6]  \n    - Damage from external events (weather, acts of God, insects, etc.).[2][4][6]  \n    - Bodily injury and damage to personal property or other real property.[2][4][6]  \n    - Any defects or damage arising from their own work or third\u2011party work not selected by the Builder.[2][4][6]  \n    - Any claims not timely made in writing.[2][4][6]\n\n- **Eliminating broader implied protections:**  \n  - By disclaiming implied warranties of merchantability, fitness, habitability, and good workmanship, the Builder seeks to prevent the Buyer/Owner from relying on broader, default legal protections that might otherwise impose additional liability on the Builder.[2][4][6]\n\n**Effect on default allocation:**\n\n- Without these exclusions and disclaimers, the Builder might be liable under:\n  - Implied warranties (e.g., that the home is habitable and constructed in a workmanlike manner).  \n  - Tort or contract theories for consequential damages.  \n- These clauses **reallocate** that risk by:\n  - Limiting the Builder\u2019s liability to a narrow, defined set of defects and time periods.  \n  - Shifting the remaining risks (maintenance, external events, many types of damage and injury, and broader quality expectations) to the Buyer/Owner.[2][4][6]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- All three statements are **risk allocation mechanisms**, but they operate differently:\n  1. **Risk of Loss clause** allocates **property damage risk over time** (pre\u2011 vs. post\u2011delivery) between Contractor and Customer.[9][12]\n  2. **Hold Harmless clause** allocates **third\u2011party claim and premises\u2011liability risk** between Owner and Agent, largely shifting it to the Owner and requiring indemnity.[1][10][11]\n  3. **Warranty exclusions/disclaimers** allocate **construction defect, damage, and warranty risk** between Builder and Buyer/Owner, heavily limiting the Builder\u2019s exposure and shifting many risks to the Buyer/Owner.[2][4][6]\n\n- Each clause modifies what would otherwise be the **default legal allocation** of risk:\n  - The risk\u2011of\u2011loss clause clarifies when risk passes from seller/contractor to buyer/customer.[9][12]\n  - The hold\u2011harmless clause insulates the Agent from most liability that might otherwise arise from its management activities.[1][10][11]\n  - The warranty provisions restrict and disclaim obligations that might otherwise be implied by law.[2][4][6]\n\n- Together, they illustrate three distinct **contractual tools** for risk allocation:\n  - Timing\u2011based allocation (risk of loss at delivery).  \n  - Indemnity/hold\u2011harmless allocation (one party protects another from third\u2011party claims).  \n  - Warranty limitation/disclaimer (narrowing the scope of what is covered and shifting the rest).\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe three different \u201crisk allocation\u201d statements and how each shifts liability are:\n\n1. **Purchase Contract \u2013 \u201c5. Risk of Loss\u201d**:  \n   - Identified as clause \u201c### 5. Risk of Loss.\u201d[9][12]  \n   - Shifts liability for loss or damage to the lift from the **Contractor** (Contoso Lifts LLC) before delivery to the **Customer** (Fabrikam Inc.) after delivery.[9][12]\n\n2. **Property Management Agreement \u2013 \u201cHOLD HARMLESS\u201d**:  \n   - Identified as the \u201cHOLD HARMLESS\u201d section.[1][10][11]  \n   - Shifts most liability for loss or injury on the property from the **Agent** (Walt Flood Realty) to the **Owner** (Contoso Ltd.), with the Owner agreeing to hold the Agent harmless and indemnify the Agent, except where the Agent\u2019s gross negligence or willful misconduct is the cause.[1][10][11]\n\n3. **Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty \u2013 \u201c4. Exclusions from Coverage\u201d and \u201c5. No Other Warranties\u201d**:  \n   - Identified by those headings in the warranty.[2][4][6]  \n   - Shifts a wide range of risks (consequential damages, wear and tear, acts of God, bodily injury, many defects, and implied warranty protections) away from the **Builder** (Fabrikam Inc.) and onto the **Buyer/Owner** (Contoso Ltd.) by excluding coverage and disclaiming implied warranties.[2][4][6]\n\nThese three clauses collectively demonstrate how contracts use different types of provisions to allocate and shift liability between parties.",

          "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1: How is an emergency defect defined, and what conditions qualify (e.g., burst pipe)?\n\nThe Builders Limited Warranty covers defects in major systems (including plumbing) for one year, subject to its terms.[10][64] It does not use a formal term like \u201cemergency defect,\u201d but it does distinguish between ordinary defects and situations that are emergencies or where delay would cause extra damage.\n\nIn the \u201cNotification of Defects\u201d section, it states:\n\n> \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.\u201d[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n\nFrom this, a defect qualifies as an \u201cemergency\u201d when:\n- An emergency exists, **or**\n- A delay in response \u201cwill cause extra damage,\u201d with a **burst defective pipe** given as the explicit example.[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n\nSo a burst pipe under the warranty is clearly treated as an emergency situation.\n\n### Q2: What channels are mentioned or allowed for reporting an emergency defect?\n\nThe warranty provides two distinct reporting channels:\n\n1. **Written notice by certified mail** \u2013 required for all non\u2011emergency warranty claims:\n   - The Buyer/Owner \u201cmust, prior to the termination of the \u2026 warranty period, write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder\u2019s office address below.\u201d[10][19][34][40][69][72][77][83][88]\n\n2. **Telephone** \u2013 specifically and exclusively for emergencies:\n   - \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately. **Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.**\u201d[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n\nNo other channels (email, online portal, etc.) are mentioned for emergency reporting.\n\n### Q3: Is there a required channel for emergency defects, and how is it stated?\n\nYes. The required channel for emergency defects is **telephone**.\n\nThe requirement is stated in mandatory language:\n\n- \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner **must telephone the Builder immediately. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.**\u201d[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n\nThis does two things:\n- Imposes a duty (\u201cmust telephone\u201d) to use the phone for emergencies.\n- Limits phone use to emergencies (\u201cOnly emergency reports will be taken by phone\u201d).\n\n### Q4: Are there timing, after\u2011hours, or backup\u2011channel requirements?\n\nThe warranty adds timing and consequence language, but does not specify after\u2011hours or backup channels:\n\n- **Timing / urgency**: The Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder \u201cimmediately\u201d if an emergency exists or delay will cause extra damage.[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n- **Consequence of not reporting promptly**:\n  - \u201cFailure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.\u201d[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n\nThere is **no explicit mention** of:\n- After\u2011hours procedures,\n- Alternative or backup channels if the phone is unavailable,\n- Special time windows beyond \u201cimmediately.\u201d\n\nThe only clearly prescribed emergency procedure is to call the Builder\u2019s phone number listed in the notification section.[10][19][34][40][69][72][77][83][88]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The warranty distinguishes **ordinary defects** (reported in writing by certified mail) from **emergency situations** (e.g., burst pipe) that must be reported by **telephone**.[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n- A burst pipe is explicitly used as the example of a situation where delay causes extra damage, triggering the emergency reporting rule.[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n- The same notification clause both:\n  - Defines the emergency reporting channel (telephone),\n  - And sets the consequence for failing to use it promptly (loss of the Builder\u2019s liability).[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Builders Limited Warranty, if an emergency defect occurs under the warranty\u2014such as a burst pipe\u2014the Buyer/Owner is required to **notify the Builder by telephone immediately**. The warranty states that \u201conly emergency reports will be taken by phone\u201d and that failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and other damages.[10][19][34][40][64][69][72][77][83][88]",

Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.\u201d\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011\u30102\u2020L63-L67\u3011\n\nThus, for an emergency defect such as a burst pipe, the required notification channel is a **telephone call to the Builder** (using the emergency number listed in the warranty)\u30101\u2020L55-L63\u3011.\n\n### Q3, Q6 & Q8 \u2013 What timeframes or deadlines apply, and how is the requirement stated?\n\nThere are two layers of timing requirements:\n\n1. **Overall warranty period / written-claim deadline**  \n   - All warranty claims must be made **within the applicable warranty term** (one year or sixty days, depending on the item) and **in writing as provided**:\n     > \u201cANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.\u201d\u30102\u2020L1-L7\u3011\u30103\u2020L1-L7\u3011\n\n   - For standard defects, this means a written letter by certified mail within the applicable period\u30101\u2020L55-L62\u3011.\n\n2. **Emergency notification timing**  \n   - For emergencies (including a burst pipe), the timing requirement is **immediate telephone notification**:\n     > \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately.\u201d\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011\u30102\u2020L63-L67\u3011\n\n   - The requirement is stated as \u201cmust telephone \u2026 immediately,\u201d indicating no grace period for delay in reporting emergencies\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011.\n\n### Q4 & Q9 \u2013 How is the requirement tied to using the required notification channel?\n\nThe warranty explicitly links:\n\n- The **emergency nature** of the defect,\n- The **required channel** (telephone), and\n- The **consequences** of not using that channel promptly.\n\nKey language:\n\n1. **Channel restriction for emergencies**  \n   - \u201cOnly emergency reports will be taken by phone.\u201d\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011\u30102\u2020L63-L67\u3011  \n   This means:\n   - Phone is reserved for emergencies.\n   - For an emergency (like a burst pipe), the phone is the required and accepted channel.\n\n2. **Consequences of failing to promptly notify via the required channel**  \n   - \u201cFailure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.\u201d\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011\u30102\u2020L63-L67\u3011\n\nThis creates a direct dependency:\n\n- If an emergency defect (e.g., burst pipe) occurs, the Buyer/Owner **must**:\n  - Use the **telephone** to notify the Builder, and\n  - Do so **promptly/immediately**\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011.\n- If the Buyer/Owner fails to promptly notify the Builder of the emergency (i.e., does not use the required emergency channel in a timely way), the Builder is **relieved of all liability** for replacement, repair, and any other damages related to that emergency\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011.\n\nThus, using the telephone immediately is not just a procedural preference; it is a condition for maintaining warranty coverage for emergency defects.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Definition \u2192 Channel**: An \u201cemergency\u201d is any defect where delay will cause extra damage, with a burst pipe as the example\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011. For such emergencies, the warranty mandates **telephone notification** and restricts phone use to emergencies\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011.\n- **Channel \u2192 Timing**: The emergency channel (phone) is tied to an **immediate** notification requirement (\u201cmust telephone \u2026 immediately\u201d)\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011.\n- **Channel & Timing \u2192 Liability**: The warranty explicitly states that **failure to promptly notify** the Builder of an emergency (i.e., failure to use the required emergency channel in a timely manner) **relieves the Builder of all liability** for replacement, repair, and other damages\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011.\n- **Emergency vs. Non\u2011emergency**: Non\u2011emergency defects must be reported in writing by certified mail within the applicable warranty period\u30101\u2020L55-L62\u3011\u30102\u2020L1-L7\u3011, whereas emergencies require immediate phone notification, with coverage consequences if this is not done\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Builders Limited Warranty, if an emergency defect occurs under the warranty\u2014such as a burst pipe\u2014the required notification channel is a **telephone call to the Builder**, made **immediately**. The warranty states that \u201cthe Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately\u201d for emergencies and that \u201conly emergency reports will be taken by phone,\u201d and it further provides that failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and other damages\u30101\u2020L63-L67\u3011\u30102\u2020L63-L67\u3011.",

[1], [4], [7], [22], [23], [24], [33], [36], [55]\n\nSo, for invoices related to this vertical platform lift:\n\n- The vendor on the invoice is **Contoso Lifts LLC**.

[1], [4], [7], [22], [23], [24], [33], [36], [55]  \n- Neither the Purchase Contract nor the invoice explicitly describes a separate, ongoing **maintenance contract**; the only maintenance\u2011like obligation in the Purchase Contract is the 90\u2011day labor warranty and manufacturer\u2019s warranty. [2], [3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [18], [25], [26], [27], [28], [31], [32], [34], [35], [48], [50], [56], [58], [78], [80], [82], [84]\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Vendor responsible for the vertical platform lift work (including any implied maintenance under the contract):**  \n  The Purchase Agreement identifies **Contoso Lifts LLC** as the Contractor responsible for furnishing, installing, and warranting the vertical platform lift.

[2], [3], [5], [6], [8], [9], [18], [25], [26], [27], [28], [31], [32], [34], [35], [48], [50], [56], [58], [78], [80], [82], [84]  \n  The invoice from Contoso Lifts LLC demands the **entire $29,900.00 \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d** as an \u201cInitial payment,\u201d which accelerates all payments to the signing date and omits the delivery and completion milestones.

[2], [3], [5], [6], [18], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [35]\u2013[36], [47]\u2013[49], [51], [54], [56], [65]\u2013[67], [69], [71]\u2013[72], [75]\u2013[76]\n\nSo, the same vendor\u2014**Contoso Lifts LLC**\u2014appears in both the Purchase Contract and the invoice.\n\n### Q3: Payment schedule in the original Purchase Agreement (for the lift)\n\nThe Purchase Contract\u2019s payment terms are:\n\n- **Total price:** $29,900.00  \n- **Installments:**  \n  - $20,000.00 upon signing  \n  - $7,000.00 upon delivery  \n  - $2,900.00 upon completion [2], [3], [5], [6], [18], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [35]\u2013[36], [47]\u2013[49], [51], [54], [56], [65]\u2013[67], [69], [71]\u2013[72], [75]\u2013[76]\n\nThis is the original contract payment schedule for the vertical platform lift.\n\n### Q4: Payment terms on the invoice and whether they match the Purchase Agreement\n\nOn the Contoso Lifts LLC invoice:\n\n- **Total amount due:** $29,900.00 (subtotal/total) [1], [4], [7], [30]\u2013[34], [53], [64]  \n- **Comments / special instructions:** \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d [1], [4], [7], [30]\u2013[34], [53], [64]  \n- **Terms / due date:** \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d [1], [4], [7], [30]\u2013[34], [53], [64]\n\nThe invoice is for the full contract amount ($29,900.00) and labels it as an \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract,\u201d with terms \u201cDue on contract signing.\u201d [1], [4], [7], [30]\u2013[34], [53], [64]\n\nHowever, the Purchase Contract specifies that only **$20,000.00** is due upon signing, with additional payments due later upon delivery and completion. [2], [3], [5], [6], [18], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [35]\u2013[36], [47]\u2013[49], [51], [54], [56], [65]\u2013[67], [69], [71]\u2013[72], [75]\u2013[76]\n\nTherefore:\n\n- The **invoice payment schedule** (full $29,900 due at contract signing) **does not match** the **contract payment schedule** (three installments: $20,000 at signing, $7,000 at delivery, $2,900 at completion).\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Vendor consistency:**  \n  The same company, **Contoso Lifts LLC**, is the contractor in the Purchase Contract and the issuer of the lift invoice. [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [18], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [30]\u2013[36], [47]\u2013[49], [51], [53], [54], [56], [64]\u2013[67], [69], [71]\u2013[72], [75]\u2013[76]\n\n- **Payment schedule inconsistency:**  \n  The contract clearly staggers payments over three milestones, while the invoice demands the **entire** contract amount \u201cdue on contract signing,\u201d even though it calls this an \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract.\u201d [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [18], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [30]\u2013[36], [47]\u2013[49], [51], [53], [54], [56], [64]\u2013[67], [69], [71]\u2013[72], [75]\u2013[76]\n\nThese two findings together answer both parts of the original query: who the vendor is, and whether the invoice\u2019s payment terms align with the contract.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The vendor responsible for the vertical platform lift work (including its initial service/warranty) in the original Purchase Contract is **Contoso Lifts LLC**. [2], [3], [5], [6], [18], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [35]\u2013[36], [47]\u2013[49], [51], [54], [56], [65]\u2013[67], [69], [71]\u2013[72], [75]\u2013[76]\n\n- The maintenance / lift invoice is also issued by **Contoso Lifts LLC**, so the vendor on the invoice **matches** the vendor named in the Purchase Contract. [1], [4], [7], [30]\u2013[34], [53], [64]\n\n- The **invoice\u2019s payment schedule does not match** the Purchase Contract\u2019s payment terms: the contract calls for three installments ($20,000 at signing, $7,000 at delivery, $2,900 at completion), whereas the invoice requests the full $29,900 \u201cdue on contract signing\u201d as an \u201cinitial payment.\u201d [1], [2], [3], [5], [6], [18], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [30]\u2013[36], [47]\u2013[49], [51], [53], [54], [56], [64]\u2013[67], [69], [71]\u2013[72], [75]\u2013[76]",

Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf. Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent. In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.\u201d [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n\nThere is **no explicit \u201cearly termination fee,\u201d liquidated damages formula, or penalty amount**. Instead, the \u201cfinancial consequences\u201d of termination are:\n\n1. **60\u2011day notice requirement** \u2013 either party must give 60 days\u2019 written notice to terminate. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n\n2. **Survival of obligations and expenses** \u2013 even after termination, the Owner:\n   - \u201cshall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent\u201d [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n   - must \u201chonor all confirmed reservations\u201d if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n\n3. **Ongoing fee structure that applies while the agreement is in force** \u2013 the Agent\u2019s fees include:\n   - 25% of gross revenues for short\u2011term/vacation rentals [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n   - 10% of gross revenues for long\u2011term leases [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n   - $75/month advertising charge for short\u2011term rentals [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n   - $50/month minimum administration/accounting charge [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n   - 10% fee on repairs/upgrades/renovations [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n   - $35/hour for scheduling/escorting contractors [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n   - Hawaii gross excise tax (4.712%) on all these fees [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n   - A non\u2011refundable $250 start\u2011up fee paid at execution [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n\nNone of these are triggered *because* of early termination; they are simply the normal economic terms while the contract is active. The only \u201ctermination\u2011related\u201d financial exposure is that the Owner must:\n\n- continue to pay any obligations/expenses already incurred by the Agent, and  \n- continue to honor (and thus service) all confirmed reservations, even after the management relationship ends. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n\nSo, **there is no explicit financial penalty clause for early termination** in the Property Management Agreement; the strictness is indirect and limited to honoring existing commitments and paying already\u2011incurred costs.\n\n---\n\n### Q2 \u2013 Holding Tank Servicing Contract: financial penalties for early termination\n\nThe Holding Tank Servicing Contract states:\n\n> \u201cThis agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract. In the event of a change in this contract, the owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the County named above within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract.\u201d [2][53][56][72]\n\nKey points:\n\n- Either the owner or the pumper may terminate; there is **no minimum term** and no notice period specified. [2][53][56][72]\n- The only obligation upon change/termination is an administrative filing requirement with the municipality and County within 10 business days. [2][53][56][72]\n- The owner must pay the pumper \u201cfor charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.\u201d [2][53][56][72]\n\nThere is **no clause that imposes any fee, liquidated damages, or other financial penalty specifically for early termination**. The owner simply pays for services already rendered and must handle the regulatory paperwork.\n\nThus, the Holding Tank Servicing Contract has **no financial penalties for early termination at all**; termination is essentially penalty\u2011free, aside from paying for past services and complying with filing requirements.\n\n---\n\n### Q3 \u2013 What does this indicate about relative strictness?\n\nComparing the two:\n\n- **Property Management Agreement**\n  - Requires 60 days\u2019 written notice to terminate. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n  - Owner must honor all confirmed reservations even after termination or sale. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n  - Owner remains responsible for all obligations/expenses already incurred by the Agent. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n  - No explicit \u201cearly termination fee,\u201d but these continuing obligations can have real financial impact.\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n  - Can be terminated by either party at any time (no term or notice requirement stated). [2][53][56][72]\n  - No obligation to continue service after termination; only to file updated contract information with the County/municipality within 10 business days. [2][53][56][72]\n  - No early termination fee or liquidated damages; owner just pays for services already performed. [2][53][56][72]\n\nThis indicates that, **relative to the Holding Tank Servicing Contract, the Property Management Agreement is stricter** in terms of financial consequences tied to termination, even though it does not label them as \u201cpenalties.\u201d The need to give notice, honor reservations, and pay all incurred obligations creates more ongoing financial exposure than the essentially penalty\u2011free termination in the holding tank contract.\n\n---\n\n### Q4 \u2013 How do these factors affect overall strictness of financial penalties?\n\n**Property Management Agreement**\n\nFactors increasing strictness:\n\n1. **Notice period** \u2013 The 60\u2011day written notice requirement means the terminating party (especially the Owner) cannot immediately stop incurring management fees and related costs; they will continue for at least two more months. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n\n2. **Survival of obligations and expenses** \u2013 The Owner must pay all obligations and expenses the Agent has already incurred (e.g., advertising, housekeeping, maintenance, repairs) even after termination. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73] Given the fee schedule (commissions, monthly charges, repair mark\u2011ups), these obligations can be significant. [3][6][8][20][23][32][33][34][37][38][39][44][45][49][50][51][52][54][57][59][61][65][68][69][73][74][75]\n\n3. **Honoring confirmed reservations** \u2013 If the Owner terminates or sells the property, they must still honor all confirmed reservations. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73] This can mean:\n   - continuing to make the property available,\n   - potentially continuing to pay the Agent (depending on how reservations are handled post\u2011termination), or\n   - at minimum, bearing the operational costs and risks associated with those stays.\n\nThese are not framed as \u201cpenalties,\u201d but they **function as financial constraints** that limit the Owner\u2019s ability to cut off costs immediately upon termination.\n\n**Holding Tank Servicing Contract**\n\nFactors affecting strictness:\n\n1. **No notice period or minimum term** \u2013 The contract \u201cwill remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract\u201d with no specified notice or minimum duration. [2][53][56][72] This makes termination very flexible.\n\n2. **No survival of future obligations** \u2013 Once terminated, there is no requirement to continue using that pumper or to pay for future services. The owner only pays for services already rendered. [2][53][56][72]\n\n3. **Administrative filing requirement** \u2013 The only post\u2011change obligation is to file the new or changed contract with the municipality and County within 10 business days. [2][53][56][72] This is a compliance duty, not a financial penalty.\n\nOverall, these factors make the Holding Tank Servicing Contract **very lenient** regarding early termination; there is essentially no financial penalty beyond paying for past work.\n\n---\n\n### Q5 \u2013 Which contract imposes stricter financial penalties for early termination, and why?\n\nTaking into account total potential financial exposure for a party who terminates early:\n\n- Under the **Property Management Agreement**, an Owner who terminates:\n  - must give 60 days\u2019 notice, during which normal fees and charges continue to accrue. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n  - remains liable for all obligations and expenses already incurred by the Agent (e.g., advertising, maintenance, repairs, commissions). [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n  - must honor all confirmed reservations, which can extend financial commitments beyond the termination date. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n\n  Depending on the number of reservations and the scale of incurred expenses, this can represent substantial ongoing financial exposure.\n\n- Under the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, a party who terminates:\n  - can do so at any time (no notice or minimum term specified). [2][53][56][72]\n  - has no obligation to continue service or pay any early termination fee.\n  - only needs to pay for services already performed and file updated contract information with the County/municipality. [2][53][56][72]\n\nThus, **the Property Management Agreement imposes stricter financial consequences associated with termination** than the Holding Tank Servicing Contract, even though neither uses the label \u201cearly termination penalty.\u201d The strictness arises from:\n\n- the mandatory notice period,\n- the survival of financial obligations and expenses, and\n- the requirement to honor all confirmed reservations.\n\nBy contrast, the Holding Tank Servicing Contract allows termination with virtually no forward\u2011looking financial burden.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- Both contracts allow either party to terminate, but:\n  - Property Management Agreement: termination is conditioned on 60\u2011day notice and continued financial obligations. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n  - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: termination is open\u2011ended and penalty\u2011free, aside from paying for past services and filing paperwork. [2][53][56][72]\n\n- Neither contract contains a classic \u201cliquidated damages\u201d or \u201cearly termination fee\u201d clause, but the **practical financial impact** of termination is much heavier in the Property Management Agreement due to ongoing obligations and reservations.\n\n- Therefore, when interpreting \u201cfinancial penalties\u201d broadly as any financial burden triggered or preserved by early termination, the Property Management Agreement is materially stricter.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThere are **no explicit early\u2011termination penalty or liquidated\u2011damages clauses** in either the Property Management Agreement or the Holding Tank Servicing Contract. However:\n\n- The **Property Management Agreement** effectively imposes stricter financial consequences on early termination through its 60\u2011day notice requirement, the Owner\u2019s continuing responsibility for all obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent, and the obligation to honor all confirmed reservations. [20][23][32][37][44][45][49][52][57][66][73]\n\n- The **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** allows termination at will, with no notice period, no survival of future payment obligations, and no early termination fee; the owner simply pays for services already rendered and files updated contract information with the County/municipality. [2][53][56][72]\n\nAccordingly, **the Property Management Agreement imposes stricter \u201cfinancial penalties\u201d for early termination than the Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, because termination under the Property Management Agreement leaves the Owner with more and longer\u2011lasting financial obligations.",

Property Management Agreement \u2013 financial penalties for early termination\n\nThe Property Management Agreement sets out the term and how it can be ended, but it does **not** specify any explicit \u201cearly termination\u201d fee or liquidated damages.\n\n**Term and termination mechanics**\n\n- Initial term: 12 months from 2010\u201106\u201115, automatically renewing for successive one\u2011year terms.[17]  \n- Either party may terminate \u201cupon sixty (60) days written notice.\u201d[17]  \n- Termination \u201cdoes not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.\u201d[17]  \n- Upon termination, the Owner \u201cshall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.\u201d[17]  \n- If the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, the Owner \u201cshall honor all confirmed reservations.\u201d[17]\n\n**Fees and charges that continue despite termination**\n\nThe agreement lists a number of ongoing fees payable to the Agent:\n\n- 25% of gross revenues for short\u2011term/vacation rentals.[6]  \n- 10% of gross revenues for long\u2011term leases.[6]  \n- $75/month advertising pro\u2011ration for short\u2011term rentals.[6]  \n- $50/month minimum administration/accounting charge.[6]  \n- 10% fee on total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations.[6]  \n- $35/hour to schedule/escort contractors, etc.[6]  \n- Hawaii Gross Excise Tax (4.712%) on all the above fees.[6]  \n- A non\u2011refundable $250 agency start\u2011up fee, paid upon execution.[6]\n\nHowever, none of these are framed as **penalties for early termination**. Instead:\n\n- The start\u2011up fee is expressly \u201cnon\u2011refundable\u201d but is due \u201cupon the execution of this Agreement,\u201d not upon termination.[6]  \n- The Owner\u2019s obligation \u201cupon termination\u201d is to remain responsible for \u201cobligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent\u201d and to honor existing reservations.[17] That means the Owner must still pay:\n  - Commissions on rentals already booked,\n  - Any advertising, admin, repair, or scheduling charges already incurred,\n  - Applicable excise tax on those amounts.[6][17]\n\nThere is **no clause** that:\n\n- Imposes a lump\u2011sum termination fee,\n- Requires payment of commissions for future, hypothetical rentals after termination,\n- Accelerates future monthly fees beyond what has already been incurred.\n\nSo, in this agreement, the \u201cfinancial consequences\u201d of ending early are:\n\n- Continuing liability for all **already\u2011incurred** obligations and expenses, including commissions and fees tied to existing reservations and work performed.[17]  \n- No refund of the initial $250 start\u2011up fee.[6]\n\nBut these are not structured as punitive \u201cpenalties\u201d; they are standard payment of earned fees and sunk costs.\n\n### Q2. Holding Tank Servicing Contract \u2013 financial penalties for early termination\n\nThe Holding Tank Servicing Contract is very simple and likewise contains **no explicit financial penalties** for early termination.\n\nKey terms:\n\n- The owner must file a copy of the contract with the County.[2]  \n- The owner must:\n  - Allow the pumper access to service the holding tank(s),\n  - Maintain an all\u2011weather access road,\n  - \u201cPay the pumper for all charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.\u201d[2]\n- The pumper must submit service reports to the County with specified details.[2]\n- Term and termination:\n  - \u201cThis agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract.\u201d[2]\n  - If there is a change in the contract, the owner must file a copy of the changes or a new service contract with the municipality and County within 10 business days.[2]\n\nThere is **no language** that:\n\n- Requires a notice period before termination,\n- Imposes a fee or penalty for terminating,\n- Requires payment of any minimum future service charges after termination.\n\nThe only financial obligation is to pay \u201ccharges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s)\u201d as mutually agreed.[2] Once the contract is terminated, there is no express obligation to continue using or paying this pumper, beyond any services already rendered.\n\n### Q3. Is that assessment \u201cbased\u201d?\n\nInterpreting \u201cbased\u201d here as \u201cwell\u2011grounded in the actual contract language\u201d:\n\n- For the **Property Management Agreement**, the assessment that there are **no explicit early\u2011termination penalties** is grounded in:\n  - The Term clause, which allows termination on 60 days\u2019 written notice and only preserves obligations already incurred and confirmed reservations.[17]\n  - The fee schedule, which lists commissions and service fees but does not tie any additional or accelerated payments to early termination.[6]\n- For the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, the assessment that there are **no early\u2011termination penalties at all** is grounded in:\n  - The termination clause, which simply says the agreement remains in effect until either party terminates it.[2]\n  - The payment clause, which limits the owner\u2019s obligation to charges \u201cincurred in servicing\u201d the tank.[2]\n\nNo cited provision in either document contradicts these conclusions. So the comparative assessment below is directly based on the text.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n1. **Presence vs. absence of termination\u2011related financial consequences**\n\n   - Property Management Agreement:  \n     - Has a defined notice period (60 days) and explicitly preserves existing rental obligations and expenses.[17]  \n     - This means that if the Owner terminates, they still must:\n       - Allow guests with confirmed reservations to stay, and\n       - Pay the Agent all commissions and fees associated with those reservations and any other obligations already incurred.[6][17]\n     - Practically, this can create a **financial drag** after termination, especially if many future reservations are already booked.\n\n   - Holding Tank Servicing Contract:  \n     - Allows either party to terminate without any notice requirement or continuing financial obligations beyond services already performed.[2]  \n     - There is no requirement to continue using the same pumper or to pay any minimum or exit fee.\n\n2. **Nature of the obligations**\n\n   - Property Management Agreement:  \n     - The Owner\u2019s post\u2011termination obligations are tied to the Agent\u2019s prior work (booked reservations, advertising, maintenance, etc.).[6][17]  \n     - These are not labeled as penalties, but they do **limit the Owner\u2019s ability to cleanly exit** without ongoing payments for a period.\n\n   - Holding Tank Servicing Contract:  \n     - The only financial obligation is pay\u2011as\u2011you\u2011go for actual pumping services rendered.[2]  \n     - Termination cleanly stops future obligations; there is no \u201ctail\u201d of continuing payments.\n\n3. **Strictness comparison**\n\n   - In terms of **formal, explicit \u201cpenalty\u201d clauses**, both agreements are lenient: neither imposes a stated early\u2011termination fee or liquidated damages.\n   - In terms of **practical financial strictness**:\n     - The Property Management Agreement is **stricter**, because:\n       - It requires 60 days\u2019 notice,[17]\n       - It obligates the Owner to honor all confirmed reservations and pay all associated commissions and fees even after giving notice.[17][6]\n     - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract is **more flexible**, because:\n       - It allows termination at will, with no notice requirement stated,[2]\n       - It does not impose any continuing financial obligations beyond services already performed.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Property Management Agreement:**  \n  There is **no explicit early\u2011termination penalty clause**. The Owner can terminate on 60 days\u2019 written notice, but must still (1) honor all confirmed reservations and (2) pay all commissions, fees, and other expenses already incurred by the Agent, and the $250 start\u2011up fee is non\u2011refundable.[6][17] These are continuing obligations, not labeled penalties, but they do create a financial tail after termination.\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract:**  \n  There are **no financial penalties for early termination**. Either party may terminate the contract, and the Owner\u2019s only financial obligation is to pay for pumping services actually rendered up to that point.[2]\n\n- **Comparative strictness:**  \n  While neither contract imposes a formal early\u2011termination fee, the **Property Management Agreement is materially stricter** in its termination consequences, because it preserves existing reservations and all associated financial obligations after notice, whereas the **Holding Tank Servicing Contract allows a clean exit with no ongoing financial liability beyond services already provided**.[17][2]",
