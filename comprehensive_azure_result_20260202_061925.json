{"response":"## Overview\n\nThe only actual “invoice” is **Contoso Lifts LLC INVOICE** [4]. The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** [5] is the governing contract for that same transaction. The other three documents are unrelated contracts/warranties involving Contoso/Fabrikam but not this lift purchase [1][2][3]. Below:\n\n- Section 1: All inconsistencies with evidence (cross‑document and internal).\n- Section 2: Goods/services inconsistencies with detailed line‑item specs.\n- Section 3: Billing, logistics, administrative/legal inconsistencies.\n\n---\n\n## 1. All inconsistencies with corresponding evidence\n\n### 1.1. Product / model and technical specification inconsistencies\n\n**Vertical platform lift model name**\n\n- Invoice: “Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)” as a line item description, quantity 1, unit price 11200.00, total 11200.00. [4]\n- Purchase Contract: Scope of work lists “1 Vertical Platform Lift (AscendPro VPX200)” (repeated multiple times in line items and key details). [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:** The invoice bills for a **Savaria V1504** lift [4], while the contract obligates Contoso Lifts LLC to provide an **AscendPro VPX200** lift [5]. No document states that these are equivalent or that the model was changed in writing.\n\n---\n\n**Cab / cab size / configuration wording**\n\n- Invoice line item: “Special Size 42\\\" x 62\\\" cab with 90 degree Type 3”, quantity 1, unit price 5800.00, total 5800.00. [4]\n- Purchase Contract scope items (repeated): “1 Custom cab 42\\\" x 62\\\" with Type 3 90-degree access”. [5]\n\n**Difference:**  \n- Invoice: “Special Size 42\\\" x 62\\\" cab with 90 degree Type 3”. [4]  \n- Contract: “Custom cab 42\\\" x 62\\\" with Type 3 90-degree access”. [5]\n\nThe dimensions match (42\" x 62\"), and both reference “Type 3” and “90 degree”, but the terminology differs (“Special Size cab” vs “Custom cab” and “Type 3” vs “Type 3 90-degree access”). This is a **terminology/specification mismatch**, though likely describing the same configuration.\n\n---\n\n**Door specification**\n\n- Invoice: “80\\\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts, WR-500 lock, automatic door operator”, quantity 1, unit price 5000.00, total 5000.00. [4]\n- Purchase Contract: “1 Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Differences:**\n\n- Invoice adds:\n  - “80\\\" High” [4]\n  - “low profile” [4]\n  - “WR-500 lock” [4]\n  - “automatic door operator” [4]\n- Contract only states:\n  - “Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener” [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:** The invoice includes **more specific features** (height, low profile, WR‑500 lock, “automatic door operator”) than the contract’s more generic “automatic opener” and no height/lock spec. This is a **specification detail mismatch**; the contract does not confirm these exact features.\n\n---\n\n**Hall call stations description**\n\n- Invoice: “Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing”, quantity 2, unit price 1450.00, total 2900.00. [4]\n- Purchase Contract: “2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Difference:**  \n- Invoice: “Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing” (no “flush‑mount”). [4]  \n- Contract: “2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)”. [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:** The contract requires **flush‑mount** stations [5], but the invoice does not specify flush‑mount [4]. This is a **missing specification** on the invoice relative to the contract.\n\n---\n\n**Outdoor configuration wording**\n\n- Invoice: “Outdoor fitting”, quantity 1, unit price 2000.00, total 2000.00. [4]\n- Purchase Contract: “1 Outdoor configuration package” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Difference:**  \n- Invoice: “Outdoor fitting”. [4]  \n- Contract: “Outdoor configuration package”. [5]\n\nThis is a **terminology mismatch**; it is unclear if “fitting” equals “configuration package”.\n\n---\n\n**Power system wording**\n\n- Invoice: “110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts”, quantity 1, unit price 3000.00, total 3000.00. [4]\n- Purchase Contract: “1 Power system: 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Difference:**  \n- Invoice adds “operation parts”. [4]  \n- Contract simply says “Power system”. [5]\n\nThis is minor but still a **wording difference**; the contract does not explicitly say “operation parts”.\n\n---\n\n### 1.2. Price and payment term inconsistencies\n\n**Total price**\n\n- Invoice:\n  - Subtotal: 29900.00 [4]\n  - Tax: “N/A” [4]\n  - Total: 29900.00 [4]\n  - Amount Due: 29900.00 [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “Total contract price is $29,900.00” (in amounts and key details). [5]\n\n**Observation:** The **total price matches** numerically (29900.00 vs $29,900.00) [4][5]. No inconsistency on total amount.\n\n---\n\n**Payment timing / terms**\n\n- Invoice:\n  - Payment terms: “Due on contract signing” [4]\n  - Due Date (text): “Due on contract signing” [4]\n  - Comments: “Initial payment in accordance with contract” [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - Payment terms: “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:\n    - $20,000.00 upon signing\n    - $7,000.00 upon delivery\n    - $2,900.00 upon completion” (repeated three times in the terms and also as line items). [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:**  \n- Invoice demands **full 29,900.00 “Due on contract signing”** [4].  \n- Contract requires only **$20,000.00 upon signing**, with **$7,000.00 upon delivery** and **$2,900.00 upon completion** [5].\n\nThus, the invoice’s due‑on‑signing term conflicts with the contract’s **three‑installment schedule**.\n\n---\n\n**Tax treatment**\n\n- Invoice:\n  - Tax: “N/A” [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - No explicit tax line; total contract price is stated as $29,900.00 with no separate tax field. [5]\n\n**Observation:** Both effectively treat the total as 29,900.00 with no additional tax line. No direct contradiction, but the invoice explicitly says “N/A” for tax [4], while the contract is silent [5].\n\n---\n\n### 1.3. Party identity and address consistency\n\n**Buyer / Customer**\n\n- Invoice buyer:\n  - Name: “John Doe / Fabrikam Construction” [4]\n  - Company: “Fabrikam Construction” [4]\n  - Contact name: “John Doe” [4]\n  - Address: “61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155” [4]\n  - Phone: “(305) 490-5237” [4]\n  - Customer ID: “4905201” [4]\n- Purchase Contract customer:\n  - “Fabrikam Inc. (Customer), located at 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155” [5]\n  - Customer name (key details): “Fabrikam Inc.” [5]\n  - Customer address: “61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155” [5]\n\n**Differences:**\n\n- Legal entity:\n  - Invoice: “Fabrikam Construction” [4]\n  - Contract: “Fabrikam Inc.” [5]\n- Person:\n  - Invoice: “John Doe / Fabrikam Construction” [4]\n  - Contract: no individual named; only “Fabrikam Inc.” [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:** The **legal customer name** differs (“Fabrikam Construction” vs “Fabrikam Inc.”) even though the address is identical [4][5]. This is a **party identity inconsistency**.\n\n---\n\n**Seller / Contractor**\n\n- Invoice seller:\n  - Name: “Contoso Lifts LLC” [4]\n  - Address: “P.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL. 33304-0708” [4]\n  - Phone: “(561) 353-5111” [4]\n  - Fax: “(561) 211-7333” [4]\n- Purchase Contract seller:\n  - “Contoso Lifts LLC. (Contractor), located at , P.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL. 33304-0708” [5]\n  - Contractor name (key details): “Contoso Lifts LLC.” [5]\n  - Contractor address: “, P.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL. 33304-0708” [5]\n\n**Difference:** Contract address field includes a leading comma: “, P.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL. 33304-0708” [5], while invoice shows “P.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL. 33304-0708” [4]. This is a **minor formatting inconsistency**, not substantive.\n\n---\n\n**Bill To vs Ship To**\n\n- Invoice:\n  - Bill To Name: “John Doe” [4]\n  - Bill To Company: “Fabrikam Construction” [4]\n  - Bill To Address: “61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155” [4]\n  - Ship To Name: “John Doe” [4]\n  - Ship To Company: “Fabrikam Construction” [4]\n  - Ship To Address: “61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155” [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - Customer address: “61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155” [5]\n  - No separate “ship to” field. [5]\n\n**Observation:** Address is consistent, but the **entity name mismatch** (Fabrikam Construction vs Fabrikam Inc.) remains [4][5].\n\n---\n\n### 1.4. Logistics and risk allocation inconsistencies\n\n**Risk of loss**\n\n- Invoice: No explicit risk‑of‑loss clause. [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” (repeated in terms and key details). [5]\n\n**Observation:** Not a direct contradiction, but the invoice is **silent** on risk allocation, while the contract explicitly allocates risk [5]. If the invoice is treated as standalone, it lacks this key term.\n\n---\n\n**Delivery timing**\n\n- Invoice:\n  - Delivery terms field is empty (“delivery_terms”: \"\"). [4]\n  - “SHIPPED VIA” field is present but value is empty. [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - Delivery terms: “Delivery expected 8-10 weeks after drawing approval. Delay causes include factory and permits.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:** The contract specifies **8–10 weeks after drawing approval** with specified delay causes [5], while the invoice provides **no delivery timing or shipping method** [4]. This is a **missing logistics detail** on the invoice relative to the contract.\n\n---\n\n### 1.5. Legal / administrative inconsistencies or gaps\n\n**Governing law**\n\n- Invoice: No governing law clause. [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “This contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Observation:** The invoice is silent; the contract is explicit. If the invoice is interpreted as incorporating the contract, governing law is Florida [5]. No direct contradiction, but the invoice alone lacks this.\n\n---\n\n**Cancellation / right to cancel**\n\n- Invoice: No cancellation or refund terms. [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “Customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.” (repeated multiple times in dates and terms). [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:** The invoice demands full payment “Due on contract signing” [4] but does not mention the **3‑day cancellation right** and **deposit forfeiture** that the contract provides [5]. This is a **material omission** on the invoice relative to the contract.\n\n---\n\n**Warranty**\n\n- Invoice: No warranty terms. [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “Manufacturer warranty applies. Contractor warrants labor for 90 days.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Observation:** The invoice omits warranty information that is present in the contract [5]. Not a contradiction, but a **missing legal term** on the invoice.\n\n---\n\n**Changes / modifications**\n\n- Invoice:\n  - Comments: “Initial payment in accordance with contract” [4]\n  - No explicit change‑order clause.\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Observation:** The contract has a formal change clause [5]; the invoice does not. Again, a **missing term** on the invoice.\n\n---\n\n**Default / legal fees**\n\n- Invoice: No default or legal fee clause. [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “Failure to pay may result in legal action. Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Observation:** The invoice is silent; the contract explicitly allows recovery of legal fees [5].\n\n---\n\n**Assignment**\n\n- Invoice: No assignment clause. [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Observation:** Missing on invoice.\n\n---\n\n**Permitting and compliance costs**\n\n- Invoice: No mention of permitting or compliance costs. [4]\n- Purchase Contract:\n  - “Contractor assists with permitting. Customer bears any additional compliance costs.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Observation:** Another **missing administrative term** on the invoice.\n\n---\n\n**Comparison with other documents (contextual inconsistencies)**\n\nWhile not directly tied to the lift invoice, note that:\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty with Arbitration** [1] and **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** [2] and **Property Management Agreement** [3] all involve **Contoso Ltd.** and **Fabrikam Inc.** in various roles (Buyer/Owner, Pumper, Owner, Agent, etc.) [1][2][3], but:\n  - The lift invoice/contract involve **Contoso Lifts LLC** and **Fabrikam Inc. / Fabrikam Construction / John Doe** [4][5].\n  - These other documents have **different governing laws** (Idaho [1], Wisconsin [2], Hawaii [3]) vs Florida for the lift contract [5].\n- This shows that **names “Contoso” and “Fabrikam” are reused for different entities and roles** across documents [1][2][3][4][5], but there is no contractual linkage between those other agreements and the lift invoice/contract.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Inconsistencies in goods or services sold (line‑item specifications)\n\nBelow are all line items from the invoice [4] and the contract [5], with detailed comparison.\n\n### 2.1. Invoice line items (Contoso Lifts LLC INVOICE) [4]\n\n1. **Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)**  \n   - Quantity: “1” [4]  \n   - Unit price: “11200.00” [4]  \n   - Total: “11200.00” [4]\n\n2. **110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts**  \n   - Quantity: “1” [4]  \n   - Unit price: “3000.00” [4]  \n   - Total: “3000.00” [4]\n\n3. **Special Size 42\\\" x 62\\\" cab with 90 degree Type 3**  \n   - Quantity: “1” [4]  \n   - Unit price: “5800.00” [4]  \n   - Total: “5800.00” [4]\n\n4. **Outdoor fitting**  \n   - Quantity: “1” [4]  \n   - Unit price: “2000.00” [4]  \n   - Total: “2000.00” [4]\n\n5. **80\\\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts, WR-500 lock, automatic door operator**  \n   - Quantity: “1” [4]  \n   - Unit price: “5000.00” [4]  \n   - Total: “5000.00” [4]\n\n6. **Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing**  \n   - Quantity: “2” [4]  \n   - Unit price: “1450.00” [4]  \n   - Total: “2900.00” [4]\n\nSubtotal: “29900.00” [4]  \nTax: “N/A” [4]  \nTotal: “29900.00” [4]\n\n---\n\n### 2.2. Contract scope line items (PURCHASE CONTRACT) [5]\n\nThe contract’s **amounts.line_items** and **key_details** repeat the scope items multiple times:\n\nScope items (each appears three times in the amounts list and again in key_details):\n\n1. “1 Vertical Platform Lift (AscendPro VPX200)” [5]\n2. “1 Power system: 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down” [5]\n3. “1 Custom cab 42\\\" x 62\\\" with Type 3 90-degree access” [5]\n4. “1 Outdoor configuration package” [5]\n5. “1 Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener” [5]\n6. “2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)” [5]\n\nPayment schedule items (also repeated):\n\n7. “$20,000.00 upon signing” with amount “$20,000.00” [5]\n8. “$7,000.00 upon delivery” with amount “$7,000.00” [5]\n9. “$2,900.00 upon completion” with amount “$2,900.00” [5]\n10. “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:” with amount “$29,900.00” (repeated three times). [5]\n\nTotal contract price: “$29,900.00” [5]\n\n---\n\n### 2.3. Line‑by‑line comparison and inconsistencies\n\n**Lift unit**\n\n- Invoice: “Vertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504)” [4]\n- Contract: “1 Vertical Platform Lift (AscendPro VPX200)” [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:** Different model names (Savaria V1504 vs AscendPro VPX200) for the same “Vertical Platform Lift” concept.\n\n---\n\n**Power system**\n\n- Invoice: “110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts” [4]\n- Contract: “1 Power system: 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down” [5]\n\n**Difference:** Invoice adds “operation parts” and omits the explicit “Power system” label; contract includes “Power system” but no “operation parts”. Likely same function, but wording differs.\n\n---\n\n**Cab**\n\n- Invoice: “Special Size 42\\\" x 62\\\" cab with 90 degree Type 3” [4]\n- Contract: “1 Custom cab 42\\\" x 62\\\" with Type 3 90-degree access” [5]\n\n**Differences:**\n\n- “Special Size cab” vs “Custom cab” [4][5]\n- “90 degree Type 3” vs “Type 3 90-degree access” [4][5]\n\nDimensions (42\" x 62\") match; the rest is terminology.\n\n---\n\n**Outdoor configuration**\n\n- Invoice: “Outdoor fitting” [4]\n- Contract: “1 Outdoor configuration package” [5]\n\n**Difference:** “fitting” vs “configuration package”; unclear if identical.\n\n---\n\n**Door**\n\n- Invoice: “80\\\" High low profile aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts, WR-500 lock, automatic door operator” [4]\n- Contract: “1 Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener” [5]\n\n**Differences:**\n\n- Invoice specifies:\n  - “80\\\" High” [4]\n  - “low profile” [4]\n  - “WR-500 lock” [4]\n  - “automatic door operator” [4]\n- Contract only: “automatic opener” and no height/lock details [5].\n\nThus, the invoice describes a more detailed door spec than the contract.\n\n---\n\n**Hall call stations**\n\n- Invoice: “Hall Call stations for bottom and upper landing”, quantity 2 [4]\n- Contract: “2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)” [5]\n\n**Difference:** Contract requires “Flush-mount” [5]; invoice does not specify flush‑mount [4].\n\n---\n\n**Quantities**\n\n- Invoice:\n  - Lift: quantity 1 [4]\n  - Power system: quantity 1 [4]\n  - Cab: quantity 1 [4]\n  - Outdoor fitting: quantity 1 [4]\n  - Door: quantity 1 [4]\n  - Hall call stations: quantity 2 [4]\n- Contract:\n  - Lift: “1 Vertical Platform Lift (AscendPro VPX200)” [5]\n  - Power system: “1 Power system: 110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down” [5]\n  - Cab: “1 Custom cab 42\\\" x 62\\\" with Type 3 90-degree access” [5]\n  - Outdoor package: “1 Outdoor configuration package” [5]\n  - Door: “1 Aluminum door with plexi-glass inserts & automatic opener” [5]\n  - Hall call stations: “2 Flush-mount Hall Call stations (upper & lower)” [5]\n\n**Observation:** Quantities match across invoice and contract [4][5].\n\n---\n\n**Pricing per component**\n\n- Invoice provides unit prices and totals for each component [4].\n- Contract does **not** provide per‑component prices; only the total contract price and installment amounts [5].\n\n**Inconsistency / gap:** The contract does not confirm the **allocation of the 29,900.00** across components, while the invoice does. There is no explicit contradiction, but the contract cannot be used to verify each line item price.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Inconsistencies regarding billing logistics, administrative or legal issues\n\n### 3.1. Billing and payment logistics\n\n**Invoice billing details**\n\n- Invoice Number: “1256003” [4]\n- P.O. Number: “30060204” [4]\n- Customer ID: “4905201” [4]\n- Invoice Date: “12/17/2015” [4]\n- Payment terms: “Due on contract signing” [4]\n- Due Date (text): “Due on contract signing” [4]\n- Amount Due: “29900.00” [4]\n- Payment Instructions: “Make all checks payable to Contoso Lifts LLC” [4]\n- Online Payment Portal: “https://ww.contosolifts.com/portal/pay” [4]\n- Comments or Special Instructions: “Initial payment in accordance with contract” [4]\n- Shipped Via: value empty [4]\n- Requisitioner: value empty [4]\n\n**Contract billing details**\n\n- Total contract price: “$29,900.00” [5]\n- Payment terms (repeated three times):  \n  “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:\n  · $20,000.00 upon signing\n  · $7,000.00 upon delivery\n  · $2,900.00 upon completion” [5]\n- Installment 1: “$20,000.00 upon signing” [5]\n- Installment 2: “$7,000.00 upon delivery” [5]\n- Installment 3: “$2,900.00 upon completion” [5]\n- Contract effectiveness: “This contract is effective upon mutual signature and initial payment.” [5]\n\n**Key inconsistencies:**\n\n- Invoice demands **full 29,900.00 at signing** [4]; contract requires **only 20,000.00 at signing** with later installments [5].\n- Invoice references “Initial payment in accordance with contract” [4], but its own “Due on contract signing” term conflicts with the contract’s installment structure [5].\n- Invoice includes an invoice number, PO number, and customer ID [4]; the contract has no invoice number or PO number fields [5]. This is not a contradiction but a **missing cross‑reference** in the contract.\n\n---\n\n### 3.2. Delivery and shipping logistics\n\n- Invoice:\n  - Delivery terms: empty [4]\n  - “SHIPPED VIA”: label present, value empty [4]\n- Contract:\n  - Delivery: “Delivery expected 8-10 weeks after drawing approval. Delay causes include factory and permits.” (repeated). [5]\n  - Risk of loss: “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Inconsistencies / gaps:**\n\n- The invoice does not specify **delivery timing** or **shipping method** [4], while the contract does [5].\n- The invoice does not restate the **risk of loss** allocation [4]; only the contract does [5].\n\n---\n\n### 3.3. Legal and administrative terms\n\n**Governing law**\n\n- Invoice: none. [4]\n- Contract: “This contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Florida.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Gap:** Invoice lacks governing law; contract provides it.\n\n---\n\n**Cancellation / refund**\n\n- Invoice: no cancellation clause. [4]\n- Contract: “Customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.” (repeated multiple times). [5]\n\n**Inconsistency:** Invoice’s demand for full payment at signing [4] does not mention the 3‑day cancellation right and deposit forfeiture [5].\n\n---\n\n**Warranty**\n\n- Invoice: no warranty terms. [4]\n- Contract: “Manufacturer warranty applies. Contractor warrants labor for 90 days.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Gap:** Warranty is only in the contract [5].\n\n---\n\n**Changes / change orders**\n\n- Invoice: no change clause. [4]\n- Contract: “Any changes must be agreed to in writing and will affect the next payment milestone.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Gap:** Invoice does not mention how changes affect billing.\n\n---\n\n**Default and legal fees**\n\n- Invoice: no default/legal fee clause. [4]\n- Contract: “Failure to pay may result in legal action. Legal fees are recoverable by Contractor.” (repeated). [5]\n\n**Gap:** Only the contract addresses legal consequences of non‑payment.\n\n---\n\n**Assignment**\n\n- Invoice: no assignment clause. [4]\n- Contract: “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.” (repeated). [5]\n\n---\n\n**Permitting and compliance**\n\n- Invoice: no mention. [4]\n- Contract: “Contractor assists with permitting. Customer bears any additional compliance costs.” (repeated). [5]\n\n---\n\n### 3.4. Comparison with other agreements (administrative/legal context)\n\nOther documents show different legal frameworks and parties:\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty with Arbitration** [1]:\n  - Parties: Buyer/Owner “Contoso Ltd.” and Builder “Fabrikam Inc.” [1]\n  - Governing law/venue: Small Claims Court of the State of Idaho; binding arbitration for other disputes [1]\n  - Extensive warranty exclusions and arbitration program [1]\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** [2]:\n  - Holding Tank Owner: “Contoso Ltd.” [2]\n  - Pumper: “Fabrikam Inc.” [2]\n  - Governing code: “WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5” [2]\n  - County: “County of Washburn” [2]\n  - Filing obligations with County and municipality [2]\n- **Property Management Agreement** [3]:\n  - Owner: “Contoso Ltd.” [3]\n  - Agent: “Walt Flood Realty, a Hawaii sole proprietorship” [3]\n  - Property: “456 Palm Tree Avenue, Honolulu, HI 96815” [3]\n  - Governing law: “Laws of the State of Hawaii” [3]\n  - Various fees, commissions, and Hawaii Gross Excise tax at 4.712% [3]\n\nThese show that **Contoso Ltd.** and **Fabrikam Inc.** appear in multiple unrelated contracts with different governing laws (Idaho, Wisconsin, Hawaii) [1][2][3], whereas the lift purchase is governed by Florida law and involves **Contoso Lifts LLC** and **Fabrikam Inc. / Fabrikam Construction / John Doe** [4][5]. There is no explicit cross‑reference between these other agreements and the lift invoice/contract.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Missing information relevant to the invoice\n\n- The **invoice** does not:\n  - Identify the **contract number** or date of the purchase contract [4][5].\n  - Specify **delivery date**, **shipping method**, or **risk of loss** [4][5].\n  - Mention **cancellation rights**, **warranty**, **governing law**, **assignment**, **permitting**, or **legal fees** [4][5].\n  - Clarify whether the billed model “Savaria V1504” is an approved substitute for “AscendPro VPX200” [4][5].\n  - Clarify whether the hall call stations are **flush‑mount** as required by the contract [4][5].\n\nThese omissions, combined with the explicit inconsistencies above, are the key areas where the invoice is inconsistent with or incomplete relative to the governing purchase contract.","route_used":"route_3_global_search","citations":[{"index":1,"chunk_id":"doc_8205bc1673724d689a86d302d72da287_chunk_0","document_id":"doc_8205bc1673724d689a86d302d72da287","document_title":"BUILDERS%20LIMITED%20WARRANTY","document_url":"https://neo4jstorage21224.blob.core.windows.net/test-docs/BUILDERS%20LIMITED%20WARRANTY.pdf","score":0.0,"text_preview":"# BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY WITH ARBITRATION\n\nIn consideration of the Agreement for the construction or purchase of a home for the undersigned\nBuyer/Owner, this Limited Warranty Agreement is extended "},{"index":2,"chunk_id":"doc_2a26892fdba540b8af1e0afe1ddb544b_chunk_0","document_id":"doc_2a26892fdba540b8af1e0afe1ddb544b","document_title":"HOLDING%20TANK%20SERVICING%20CONTRACT","document_url":"https://neo4jstorage21224.blob.core.windows.net/test-docs/HOLDING%20TANK%20SERVICING%20CONTRACT.pdf","score":0.0,"text_preview":"# HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT\n\nContract Date: 2024-06-15\n\nThis contract is made between the Holding Tank Owner and the Pumper.\n\n\n<figure>\n\nHolding Tank Owner(s) Name(s):\nContoso Ltd.\n\nPumper's Nam"},{"index":3,"chunk_id":"doc_657dee67210c43f2af2649c7d71d8c8c_chunk_0","document_id":"doc_657dee67210c43f2af2649c7d71d8c8c","document_title":"PROPERTY%20MANAGEMENT%20AGREEMENT","document_url":"https://neo4jstorage21224.blob.core.windows.net/test-docs/PROPERTY%20MANAGEMENT%20AGREEMENT.pdf","score":0.0,"text_preview":"# PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT (Short Term and/or Vacation/Holiday Rentals)\n\nTHIS AGREEMENT, by and between: Contoso Ltd.\n(hereinafter called \"Owner\")\nand Walt Flood Realty, a Hawaii sole proprietors"},{"index":4,"chunk_id":"doc_6caa3b7a3af34f64b47a95a94653e70c_chunk_0","document_id":"doc_6caa3b7a3af34f64b47a95a94653e70c","document_title":"contoso_lifts_invoice","document_url":"https://neo4jstorage21224.blob.core.windows.net/test-docs/contoso_lifts_invoice.pdf","score":0.0,"text_preview":"Contoso Lifts LLC\nINVOICE\nYour elevator and lift experts\nContoso Lifts LLC\nP.O.
