  "response": "## Answer\n\n- The **purchase_contract** sets out the terms under which a contractor will furnish and install a specified vertical platform lift system, including equipment details, total price, and installment payment schedule. [7]\n- The **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** establishes an ongoing service agreement between a holding tank owner and a pumper, defining servicing obligations, reporting requirements to the county, access and maintenance duties, payment terms, and conditions for contract changes or termination. [2] [8] [10] [11] [13] [14]\n- The **contoso_lifts_invoice** document\u2019s specific purpose is not described in the available excerpts, so its main purpose cannot be determined from the provided text.\n- The **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY** defines the builder\u2019s one\u2011year limited warranty for a home\u2019s structural components and systems, disclaims other warranties, allocates arbitration costs, and states that the warranty and non-warranted conditions form the entire agreement between builder and buyer/owner. [4] [5] [6] [9] [12]\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** outlines the responsibilities of a rental agent and property owner, including the agent\u2019s duties to inspect the property, prepare it for occupancy, manage funds and provide monthly statements, and the owner\u2019s obligation to honor confirmed reservations upon termination or sale. [1] [3]\n\n## Details\n\n- The purchase contract specifies the lift model (AscendPro VPX200), power system, cab size and configuration, outdoor package, door type, hall call stations, total price of $29,900, and three payment milestones, and notes that changes must be in writing and affect the next payment. [7]\n- The holding tank contract requires the owner to file the contract with Washburn County under WI Code SPS 383.21(2)5, maintain access for the pumper, and keep an all\u2011weather access road, while the pumper must service the tank, report volumes pumped, disposal sites, and tank condition to the County, and the agreement continues until terminated or changed with notice to the municipality and County. [2] [8] [10] [11] [13] [14]\n- The builder\u2019s limited warranty is extended by Fabrikam Inc. to Contoso Ltd. for a specific property in Idaho, covers defects in materials or workmanship for certain structural and system components for one year, excludes various non\u2011warrantable conditions, disclaims implied warranties, requires each party to pay half of arbitration costs, and states that the warranty and Statement of Non\u2011Warranted Conditions are the entire integrated agreement. [4] [5] [6] [9] [12] [15]\n- The property management agreement allows the rental agent to place funds in an interest\u2011bearing account with interest accruing to the agent, requires monthly income/expense statements and distributions to the owner when available, obligates the owner to honor confirmed reservations if the agreement ends or the property is sold, and requires the agent to perform an initial inspection, prepare a condition report, and ready the unit for occupancy.
