PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\n- The agreement has a detailed \u201cAGENT\u2019S FEES\u201d section listing multiple fee types:  \n  - 25% commission on gross revenues for short\u2011term/vacation rentals [13][14][17].  \n  - 10% commission on gross revenues for long\u2011term leases [13][14][17].  \n  - 10% fee on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and renovations [13][14][17].  \n  - Hawaii Gross Excise tax of 4.712% on all the above fees and commissions [13][14][17].  \n- These are explicitly **percentage\u2011based fees** (25%, 10%, 10%, and 4.712%).  \n- The same section also includes **flat fees**:  \n  - Advertising charge: $75.00/month [13][14][17].  \n  - Administration/accounting minimum charge: $50.00/month [13][14][17].  \n  - $35/hour charge for scheduling/escorting contractors [13][14][17].  \n- There is also an **AGENCY START\u2011UP FEE** of $250.00, described as a non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee used to cover initial administrative expenses and inspections [13][14][17]. This is a flat, one\u2011time fee, not percentage\u2011based.\n\n**2. PURCHASE CONTRACT**\n\n- The contract sets a **total contract price** of $29,900.00, payable in three fixed installments: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, and $2,900 upon completion [4][5]. These are fixed amounts, not percentages.  \n- Under \u201cRight to Cancel,\u201d it states: \u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, **deposit is forfeited**\u201d [4][5].  \n- The \u201cfees\u201d concept relevant to the original query here is the **deposit**: an initial payment that is refundable if cancellation occurs within 3 days, but becomes non\u2011refundable (forfeited) after that [4][5].  \n- The contract does **not** describe any percentage\u2011based fee; all amounts are flat dollar amounts.\n\n**3. CONTOSO LIFTS INVOICE**\n\n- The invoice lists line items with unit prices and totals (e.g., $11,200.00 for the lift, $3,000.00 for operation parts, etc.) and a subtotal of $29,900.00 [9].  \n- Tax is listed as \u201cN/A\u201d and the total equals the subtotal [9].  \n- There is no separate \u201cfee\u201d concept described as a percentage or as a special fee; it is simply a price breakdown. So there is **no explicit percentage\u2011based fee** and no deposit mentioned here.\n\n**4. HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**\n\n- The owner agrees \u201cto pay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper\u201d [12].  \n- No percentages, flat fee amounts, or deposits are specified; the charges are left open\u2011ended and negotiated.  \n- Thus, there is a **service charge concept**, but it is not explicitly defined as percentage\u2011based, flat, or deposit in the text.\n\n**5. BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**\n\n- The warranty text provided focuses on warranty coverage, exclusions, arbitration, and cost sharing of arbitration.  \n- It states that \u201cEach party shall be responsible to pay for one\u2011half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration and their respective costs including attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d [1][2][3].  \n- This \u201cone\u2011half (1/2)\u201d is a **cost\u2011sharing ratio**, not a fee charged as a percentage of some revenue or price; it is not framed as a fee structure like a commission.  \n- No deposit or flat \u201cfee\u201d concept comparable to the other documents is described.\n\n### Q2 & Q5 \u2013 Which doc has percentage\u2011based fees, which has flat fees, and which has a deposit?\n\nLooking across all documents:\n\n- **Percentage\u2011based fee concept**  \n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:  \n    - 25% of gross revenues for short\u2011term/vacation rentals [13][14][17].  \n    - 10% of gross revenues for long\u2011term leases [13][14][17].  \n    - 10% of total charges for repairs/upgrades/renovations [13][14][17].  \n    - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all the above fees and commissions [13][14][17].  \n  - These are explicitly stated as percentages of defined bases (gross revenues or total charges).\n\n- **Flat fee concept**  \n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (multiple flat fees):  \n    - $75.00/month advertising charge [13][14][17].  \n    - $50.00/month administration/accounting minimum charge [13][14][17].  \n    - $35/hour scheduling/escort charge [13][14][17].  \n    - $250.00 non\u2011refundable agency start\u2011up fee [13][14][17].  \n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n    - The total price and each installment ($20,000, $7,000, $2,900) are flat amounts [4][5]. These are contract price payments rather than \u201cfees\u201d in the sense of commissions, but structurally they are fixed sums, not percentages.  \n  - **CONTOSO LIFTS INVOICE**:  \n    - All line items are fixed prices (e.g., $11,200, $3,000, etc.) [9]. Again, these are prices rather than labeled \u201cfees,\u201d but they are flat amounts.  \n  - **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**:  \n    - Refers generically to \u201ccharges incurred in servicing\u201d [12] but does not specify whether they are flat or percentage\u2011based; they are simply service charges agreed between the parties.\n\n- **Deposit concept**  \n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n    - The contract is effective upon \u201cinitial payment\u201d [4][5], and the \u201cRight to Cancel\u201d clause states that if the customer cancels after 3 business days, the \u201cdeposit is forfeited\u201d [4][5].  \n    - This clearly identifies a **deposit**: an upfront payment that is refundable within a short cancellation window and non\u2011refundable thereafter.  \n  - None of the other documents explicitly use the term \u201cdeposit\u201d in this sense.\n\nSo, in terms of the original comparison:\n\n- **Percentage\u2011based fee**: Property Management Agreement.  \n- **Flat fee**: Property Management Agreement (several), and the pricing structures in the Purchase Contract and Invoice are flat amounts.  \n- **Deposit**: Purchase Contract (initial payment that becomes a forfeitable deposit after the 3\u2011day cancellation period) [4][5].\n\n### Q4 \u2013 For non\u2011percentage fees, are they flat fees, deposits, or other?\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n  - Non\u2011percentage fees are clearly characterized as **flat fees**:  \n    - Monthly advertising charge ($75.00/month) [13][14][17].  \n    - Monthly admin/accounting minimum ($50.00/month) [13][14][17].  \n    - Hourly scheduling/escort charge ($35/hour) [13][14][17].  \n    - One\u2011time non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee ($250.00) [13][14][17].  \n  - These are defined as specific dollar amounts per month, per hour, or one\u2011time, and are intended to cover advertising, administration/accounting, coordination of work, and initial onboarding/inspection costs [13][14][17].\n\n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**  \n  - The three installment payments are flat amounts that together equal the contract price [4][5]. They are not labeled as \u201cfees\u201d but as the price for the lift and installation.  \n  - The \u201cdeposit\u201d is the initial payment that is refundable if cancellation occurs within 3 business days and forfeited thereafter [4][5]. This is a **deposit**, not a fee for a service; it functions as security and commitment for the contract.\n\n- **CONTOSO LIFTS INVOICE**  \n  - All amounts are flat prices for goods/services [9]. No separate fee type (like a service fee or deposit) is described.\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**  \n  - The \u201ccharges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s)\u201d are service charges [12]. The document does not specify whether they are flat per visit, per gallon, or percentage\u2011based; they are simply \u201ccharges\u201d mutually agreed upon. This is an **open\u2011ended service charge**, not explicitly categorized as flat, percentage, or deposit.\n\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**  \n  - The only cost\u2011related concept is that each party pays one\u2011half of arbitration costs and their own attorneys\u2019 fees [1][2][3]. This is a **cost\u2011sharing rule**, not a fee structure like a commission, flat fee, or deposit.\n\n### Q6 \u2013 Comparison across docs: definition, timing, and purpose\n\n**How they are defined**\n\n- **Property Management Agreement**:  \n  - Fees are explicitly defined by type (commission, advertising, admin, repair coordination, start\u2011up) and by formula: either a percentage of gross revenues/charges or a fixed dollar amount per month/hour/one\u2011time [13][14][17].  \n- **Purchase Contract**:  \n  - Payments are defined as fixed installments totaling the contract price [4][5]. The deposit is defined implicitly via the cancellation clause as the initial payment that may be forfeited [4][5].  \n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Prices are defined per line item with unit price and total [9].  \n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:  \n  - Charges are defined only as \u201ccharges incurred in servicing\u201d as mutually agreed [12].  \n- **Builders Limited Warranty**:  \n  - Cost sharing is defined as each party paying one\u2011half of arbitration costs [1][2][3].\n\n**When they are applied**\n\n- **Property Management Agreement**:  \n  - Percentage commissions apply when rental revenues are earned (short\u2011term or long\u2011term) [13][14][17].  \n  - The 10% repair fee applies when repairs/upgrades/renovations are performed and charged [13][14][17].  \n  - Monthly advertising and admin fees apply on an ongoing monthly basis [13][14][17].  \n  - The $35/hour charge applies when the agent schedules or escorts contractors [13][14][17].  \n  - The $250 start\u2011up fee is due upon execution of the agreement [13][14][17].  \n- **Purchase Contract**:  \n  - Installments are due at specific milestones: signing, delivery, and completion [4][5].  \n  - The deposit (initial payment) is at signing; its forfeiture condition applies if cancellation occurs after 3 business days [4][5].  \n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Amount due is \u201cDue on contract signing\u201d per the terms field [9].  \n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:  \n  - Charges apply each time the holding tank is serviced, as per mutual agreement [12].  \n- **Builders Limited Warranty**:  \n  - Arbitration cost sharing applies if a dispute goes to arbitration [1][2][3].\n\n**What they are intended to cover**\n\n- **Property Management Agreement**:  \n  - Percentage commissions: compensation for management services (renting, leasing, operating the property) [13][14][17].  \n  - 10% repair fee: compensation for managing repairs/upgrades/renovations [13][14][17].  \n  - Advertising fee: cost of marketing the property [13][14][17].  \n  - Admin/accounting fee: cost of ongoing administrative and accounting work (excluding tax prep) [13][14][17].  \n  - $35/hour: time spent coordinating and escorting contractors and service providers [13][14][17].  \n  - $250 start\u2011up fee: initial administrative expenses, inventory, and inspection report [13][14][17].  \n- **Purchase Contract**:  \n  - Installments: payment for the lift, associated equipment, and installation work [4][5].  \n  - Deposit: secures the contract and compensates the contractor if the customer cancels after the 3\u2011day window [4][5].  \n- **Invoice**:  \n  - Line item prices: payment for specific equipment and components [9].  \n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:  \n  - Service charges: payment for pumping/servicing the holding tank and related work [12].  \n- **Builders Limited Warranty**:  \n  - Arbitration cost sharing: allocation of dispute resolution costs between parties [1][2][3].\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- Only the **Property Management Agreement** contains clearly defined **percentage\u2011based fees** (commissions and a percentage on repair charges, plus a percentage tax) [13][14][17].  \n- The **Purchase Contract** is the only document that clearly uses a **deposit** concept, tied to a cancellation right and forfeiture after a 3\u2011day period [4][5].  \n- Both the **Property Management Agreement** and the **Purchase Contract** also involve **flat amounts**, but in different roles:  \n  - In the Property Management Agreement, flat amounts are explicit **fees** (advertising, admin, hourly, start\u2011up) [13][14][17].  \n  - In the Purchase Contract, flat amounts are the **contract price installments**, and the initial installment functions as a **deposit** under the cancellation clause [4][5].  \n- The **Invoice** and **Holding Tank Servicing Contract** involve charges/prices but do not define them as percentage\u2011based fees or deposits; they are either flat prices (invoice) [9] or unspecified service charges (holding tank) [12].  \n- The **Builders Limited Warranty** deals with cost sharing for arbitration, not with fees in the sense of commissions, flat service fees, or deposits [1][2][3].\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The document with an explicitly **percentage\u2011based fee** structure is the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**, which charges 25% and 10% commissions on gross revenues, 10% on repair charges, and 4.712% tax on those fees [13][14][17].  \n- The document that clearly involves a **deposit** is the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**, where the initial payment is refundable if the customer cancels within 3 business days and is forfeited thereafter (\u201cdeposit is forfeited\u201d) [4][5].  \n- Flat fees are most clearly and explicitly defined in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (monthly advertising and admin fees, hourly scheduling fee, and a $250 start\u2011up fee) [13][14][17]; the **PURCHASE CONTRACT** and **INVOICE** also use flat dollar amounts for payments/prices but not as labeled \u201cfees\u201d [4][5][9].",

          "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1: Percentage-based fees \u2013 definition and where they appear\n\n**What is a percentage-based fee?**  \nA percentage-based fee is a charge calculated as a stated percentage of some base amount (e.g., gross revenues or total charges), so the fee scales up or down with that base.\n\n**Documents with percentage-based fees**\n\nThe only document that clearly uses percentage-based fees is the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:\n\n- 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rentals:  \n  \u201cA fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).\u201d [13][14][17]\n\n- 10% of gross revenues for long-term leases:  \n  \u201cA fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).\u201d [13][14][17]\n\n- 10% of the total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations:  \n  \u201cA fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.\u201d [13][14][17]\n\nThese are all characterized as **commissions or fees** calculated as a percentage of either gross rental revenues or the total cost of repairs/renovations.\n\nNo other document in the corpus specifies a fee as a percentage of an underlying amount.\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Flat fees \u2013 definition and where they appear\n\n**What is a flat fee?**  \nA flat fee is a fixed dollar amount that does not vary with the size of the transaction or revenues (e.g., \u201c$75.00/month\u201d regardless of income).\n\n**Documents with flat fees**\n\n1. **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\n   - Advertising charge:  \n     \u201cA pro-ration charge for advertising for short-term (vacation rentals), at $75.00/month.\u201d [13][14][17]  \n     This is a fixed monthly amount, i.e., a flat fee.\n\n   - Administration and accounting charge:  \n     \u201cA minimum charge for administration and accounting, at $50.00/month (not to include tax preparation/returns/forms).\u201d [13][14][17]  \n     Again, a fixed monthly flat fee.\n\n   - Hourly charge for scheduling/escorting contractors:  \n     \u201cA charge of $35/hour to schedule repairs, upgrades, renovations, replacement of appliances, carpets, curtains, drapes, and/or to escort the contractors, repair persons, technicians and handymen.\u201d [13][14][17]  \n     This is a fixed rate per hour (not a percentage), so it is also a flat, rate-based fee.\n\n   - Hawaii Gross Excise tax is a percentage (4.712%) applied to the above fees, but that is a tax, not a fee structure of the agreement itself:  \n     \u201cPlus, the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges.\u201d [13][14][17]\n\n2. **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT \u2013 Agency start-up fee**\n\n   - \u201cUpon the execution of this Agreement, the Owner shall pay two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) to the Agent as a non-refundable start-up fee.\u201d [13][14][17]  \n     This is a one-time, fixed-dollar flat fee.\n\n3. **PURCHASE CONTRACT**\n\n   The purchase contract sets out a **fixed total price** and fixed installment amounts:\n\n   - \u201cTotal contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:  \n     \u00b7 $20,000.00 upon signing  \n     \u00b7 $7,000.00 upon delivery  \n     \u00b7 $2,900.00 upon completion\u201d [4][5]\n\n   These are fixed dollar amounts, not percentages. While they are labeled as \u201cpayment terms\u201d rather than \u201cfees,\u201d they function as flat, specified amounts owed under the contract.\n\n4. **CONTOSO LIFTS INVOICE**\n\n   The invoice lists fixed unit prices and totals:\n\n   - Example line items:  \n     \u201cVertical Platform Lift (Savaria V1504) 11200.00\u201d  \n     \u201c110 VAC 60 Hz up, 12 VAC down operation parts 3000.00\u201d  \n     \u201cSpecial Size 42\" x 62\" cab with 90 degree Type 3 5800.00\u201d  \n     etc., with a subtotal of \u201c29900.00\u201d and \u201cTOTAL 29900.00\u201d [9]\n\n   These are fixed prices per item and a fixed total; again, they are not described as \u201cfees,\u201d but they are flat monetary amounts.\n\n5. **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY** and **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**\n\n   - The Builders Limited Warranty mentions that \u201cEach party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration\u2026\u201d [1][2][3]. This is a cost-sharing rule (each pays 50%), but no specific flat dollar fee is set in the document.\n   - The Holding Tank Servicing Contract states the owner will \u201cpay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.\u201d [12] No specific flat fee amount is given.\n\nSo, explicit flat dollar fees are most clearly specified in the **Property Management Agreement** (monthly charges, hourly rate, start-up fee) [13][14][17] and in the **Purchase Contract** and **Invoice** as fixed payment amounts [4][5][9].\n\n---\n\n### Q3: Deposits \u2013 definition and where they appear\n\n**What is a deposit?**  \nIn this context, a deposit is an upfront payment (often part of the total price) that may be refundable or forfeited under certain conditions.\n\n**Documents with a deposit concept**\n\n1. **PURCHASE CONTRACT**\n\n   The contract ties effectiveness to an \u201cinitial payment\u201d and explicitly treats that as a deposit that can be forfeited:\n\n   - Contract effectiveness:  \n     \u201cThis contract is effective upon mutual signature and initial payment.\u201d [4][5]\n\n   - Right to cancel and forfeiture of deposit:  \n     \u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d [4][5]\n\n   The \u201cinitial payment\u201d functions as a **deposit**: it is paid at signing, and if the customer cancels after three business days, that deposit is lost. The document does not label a specific line as \u201cdeposit\u201d in the payment schedule, but the \u201cinitial payment\u201d upon signing is treated as the deposit that can be refunded or forfeited [4][5].\n\n2. **CONTOSO LIFTS INVOICE**\n\n   The invoice references \u201cInitial payment in accordance with contract\u201d in the comments:  \n   \u201cCOMMENTS OR SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS: Initial payment in accordance with contract\u201d [9]  \n   This ties back to the purchase contract\u2019s initial payment/deposit concept, but the invoice itself does not define deposit terms.\n\n3. **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\n   The agreement includes an \u201cAGENCY START-UP FEE\u201d of $250, explicitly called a \u201cnon-refundable start-up fee\u201d [13][14][17]. This is a one-time upfront payment, but it is characterized as a **fee**, not a deposit, and is expressly non-refundable. It is not described as being held against future obligations or refundable under conditions, so it is better classified as a flat fee rather than a deposit.\n\n4. **Other documents**\n\n   - **Builders Limited Warranty**, **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**, and the **Property Management Agreement** do not mention any \u201cdeposit\u201d or refundable upfront payment in the sense used in the purchase contract.\n\nThus, the **Purchase Contract** is the only document that clearly uses a **deposit** concept, via the initial payment that can be refunded or forfeited depending on cancellation timing [4][5].\n\n---\n\n### Q4: Comparison \u2013 which documents use percentage-based fees, flat fees, and deposits?\n\nBringing the above together:\n\n- **Percentage-based fees**\n  - **Property Management Agreement**:  \n    - 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rentals [13][14][17]  \n    - 10% of gross revenues for long-term leases [13][14][17]  \n    - 10% of total charges for repairs/upgrades/renovations [13][14][17]  \n    (Plus a separate 4.712% tax on those fees, but that is a statutory tax, not the agent\u2019s fee structure [13][14][17].)\n\n  - **No other document** specifies any fee as a percentage of revenues or charges.\n\n- **Flat fees (fixed amounts or fixed rates)**\n  - **Property Management Agreement**:  \n    - $75.00/month advertising charge [13][14][17]  \n    - $50.00/month minimum administration/accounting charge [13][14][17]  \n    - $35/hour scheduling/escort charge [13][14][17]  \n    - $250 non-refundable agency start-up fee [13][14][17]\n\n  - **Purchase Contract**:  \n    - Total contract price $29,900.00, with fixed installments of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 [4][5]. These are fixed payment amounts, not percentages.\n\n  - **Contoso Lifts Invoice**:  \n    - Fixed unit prices and a fixed total of $29,900.00 [9].\n\n  - **Builders Limited Warranty** and **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:  \n    - They refer to \u201ccost and fees\u201d or \u201ccharges\u201d but do not set specific flat dollar amounts [1][2][3][12].\n\n- **Deposits**\n  - **Purchase Contract**:  \n    - Initial payment at signing; contract effective upon \u201cinitial payment\u201d [4][5].  \n    - Right to cancel: \u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.\u201d [4][5]  \n    This clearly treats the initial payment as a **deposit** that is refundable within 3 days and forfeited thereafter.\n\n  - **Other documents**:  \n    - No explicit deposit concept. The Property Management Agreement\u2019s $250 start-up fee is non-refundable and not described as a deposit [13][14][17].\n\n---\n\n### Q5: Further comparative perspective on fee structures\n\nLooking across all documents with a focus on how \u201cfees\u201d are structured:\n\n- **Property Management Agreement** is the most fee-rich and varied:\n  - Uses **percentage-based commissions** tied to performance (gross revenues) and to repair costs [13][14][17].\n  - Uses **flat recurring fees** (monthly advertising and admin) and **flat hourly rates** [13][14][17].\n  - Uses a **one-time flat start-up fee** [13][14][17].\n  - Also passes through a statutory percentage tax on all these fees [13][14][17].\n\n- **Purchase Contract** and **Contoso Lifts Invoice**:\n  - Primarily structured around **fixed contract prices and installment payments**, not labeled as \u201cfees\u201d but as the contract price and invoice total [4][5][9].\n  - The **Purchase Contract** uniquely introduces a **deposit** concept via the initial payment that can be refunded or forfeited [4][5].\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty**:\n  - Mentions that each party pays one-half of arbitration \u201ccost and fees\u201d [1][2][3], but does not define those fees as percentage-based or flat; they are external costs to be shared.\n\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract**:\n  - Refers to \u201ccharges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon\u201d [12], leaving the fee structure open; no explicit percentage, flat fee, or deposit is defined.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Only one document uses percentage-based fees**: the **Property Management Agreement**, which ties the agent\u2019s compensation to gross revenues and repair costs [13][14][17].\n\n- **Flat fees appear in multiple documents**, but in different roles:\n  - As **service/management fees** (monthly, hourly, start-up) in the Property Management Agreement [13][14][17].\n  - As **fixed contract prices and installments** in the Purchase Contract and as line-item prices in the Invoice [4][5][9].\n\n- **Only the Purchase Contract uses a deposit concept**, via the initial payment that is refundable within a short cancellation window and forfeited afterward [4][5]. Other upfront payments (like the $250 start-up fee) are explicitly non-refundable and framed as fees, not deposits [13][14][17].\n\nThese differences show that \u201cfees\u201d in the Property Management Agreement are structured as a mix of performance-based percentages and fixed charges, while the Purchase Contract/Invoice are structured around fixed prices and a deposit mechanism, and the other contracts leave fees largely unspecified or external.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Percentage-based fee**:  \n  Only the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** uses percentage-based fees (25% and 10% commissions on gross revenues, and 10% on repair/upgrade charges) [13][14][17].\n\n- **Flat fee**:  \n  The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** uses multiple flat fees (e.g., $75/month advertising, $50/month admin, $35/hour scheduling, $250 start-up fee) [13][14][17].  \n  The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** and **CONTOSO LIFTS INVOICE** use fixed dollar amounts for the contract price and installments/line items, which are flat amounts rather than percentages [4][5][9].\n\n- **Deposit**:  \n  The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the only document that clearly requires a **deposit**, via the initial payment that makes the contract effective and is refundable within 3 business days but forfeited thereafter [4][5]. The other documents do not define a deposit in this sense.",

The key clause is the right\u2011to\u2011cancel section:\n\n- Payment structure:  \n  \u201cTotal contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:  \n  \u00b7 **$20,000.00 upon signing**  \n  \u00b7 $7,000.00 upon delivery  \n  \u00b7 $2,900.00 upon completion\u201d[4][5]\n\n- Right to cancel and deposit forfeiture:  \n  \u201cCustomer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. **Afterward, deposit is forfeited.**\u201d[4][5]\n\n**Characterization:**\n\n- The contract requires an **initial payment upon signing** ($20,000) as part of the total price.[4][5]\n- The agreement states that if the customer cancels **after** the 3\u2011business\u2011day cooling\u2011off period, the **\u201cdeposit is forfeited\u201d**.[4][5]\n- Although the contract does not explicitly say \u201cthe $20,000 is the deposit,\u201d the structure and timing (payment \u201cupon signing\u201d and later reference to \u201cdeposit\u201d forfeiture) indicate that the **initial payment functions as a deposit** that can be lost if the customer cancels late.[4][5]\n- **Conditions for payment/refund**:\n  - Deposit is paid at contract signing (initial payment).[4][5]\n  - If the customer cancels **within 3 business days**, they receive a **full refund** (so the deposit is returned).[4][5]\n  - If cancellation occurs **after 3 business days**, the **deposit is not refunded** (forfeited).[4][5]\n- **Context of use**: the deposit secures the lift purchase and installation and protects the contractor against late cancellation.\n\nNo other document in the corpus uses the term \u201cdeposit\u201d or an equivalent refundable/forfeitable upfront payment in this way.\n\n### Q4 & Q8 \u2013 Comparison: when and how each type of fee is applied\n\nNow comparing across documents:\n\n#### 1. Percentage\u2011based fees (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT)\n\n- **When applied**:\n  - Each time rental income is earned (short\u2011term or long\u2011term), the agent\u2019s commission is calculated as a **percentage of that period\u2019s gross revenues**.[13][17]\n  - Each time repairs/upgrades/renovations are done, the agent charges **10% of the total charge** for those works.[13][17]\n  - On each of these fees/commissions/charges, the agent also applies the **4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax**.[13][17]\n- **How calculated**:\n  - Commission = stated percentage \u00d7 gross rental revenues (25% or 10%).[13][17]\n  - Repair fee = 10% \u00d7 total repair/upgrade/renovation charge.[13][17]\n  - Tax = 4.712% \u00d7 sum of fees/commissions/charges.[13][17]\n- **Conditions/exceptions**:\n  - Percentages differ by **type of rental** (short\u2011term vs long\u2011term).[13][17]\n  - All are contingent on actual revenue or repair activity; if there is no revenue or no repair, no percentage fee is due.\n\n#### 2. Flat fees (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT)\n\n- **When applied**:\n  - $75/month advertising charge: applied **monthly** for short\u2011term/vacation rental advertising.[13][17]\n  - $50/month administration/accounting: applied **monthly** as a minimum charge.[13][17]\n  - $35/hour scheduling/escort charge: applied **when the agent performs those specific tasks**, based on hours worked.[13][17]\n  - $250 start\u2011up fee: applied **once, upon execution** of the agreement.[13][17]\n- **How calculated**:\n  - Fixed dollar amounts per month or per hour; not dependent on revenue levels.\n- **Conditions/exceptions**:\n  - Start\u2011up fee is explicitly **non\u2011refundable**.[13][17]\n  - Monthly fees presumably continue as long as the management agreement is in force.\n\n#### 3. Deposit (PURCHASE CONTRACT)\n\n- **When applied**:\n  - The deposit (initial payment) is due **upon signing** of the contract.[4][5]\n- **How calculated**:\n  - It is a **fixed amount** within the total price: $20,000 of the $29,900 total, paid at signing.[4][5]\n- **Conditions/exceptions**:\n  - If the customer cancels **within 3 business days**, they receive a **full refund** (deposit returned).[4][5]\n  - If they cancel **after 3 business days**, the **deposit is forfeited**.[4][5]\n  - The remaining installments ($7,000 on delivery, $2,900 on completion) are not described as \u201cfees\u201d or \u201cdeposits\u201d and are not subject to the same forfeiture language.[4][5]\n\n#### 4. How they differ in timing, triggers, and purpose\n\n- **Timing**:\n  - Percentage\u2011based fees: **ongoing**, assessed whenever revenue is earned or repairs are done during the management term.[13][17]\n  - Flat fees: **recurring (monthly)** or **event\u2011based (per hour)**, plus a **one\u2011time start\u2011up** at agreement execution.[13][17]\n  - Deposit: **upfront**, at contract signing, with its refundability determined by when cancellation occurs.[4][5]\n\n- **Triggers**:\n  - Percentage\u2011based: triggered by **economic activity** (rental income, repair expenditures).[13][17]\n  - Flat fees: triggered by **time passing** (monthly) or **specific services performed** (scheduling/escorting).[13][17]\n  - Deposit: triggered by **entering into the contract**; forfeiture is triggered by **late cancellation**.[4][5]\n\n- **Calculation method**:\n  - Percentage\u2011based: **variable**, proportional to a base amount (gross revenues or repair charges).[13][17]\n  - Flat fees: **fixed amounts** per period or per hour, independent of revenue.[13][17]\n  - Deposit: **fixed amount** that is part of the total purchase price; not a fee for services but a **security/commitment payment** that can be lost.[4][5]\n\n- **Conditions/exceptions**:\n  - Percentage\u2011based fees vary by rental type (short vs long term) and are subject to tax.[13][17]\n  - Flat fees include a non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee and minimum monthly charges.[13][17]\n  - Deposit is refundable only within a defined **3\u2011day cooling\u2011off period**; otherwise forfeited.[4][5]\n\n### Other documents\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** mentions that the owner will \u201cpay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon\u201d[12], but it does not specify percentage\u2011based fees, flat fee amounts, or deposits.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY** and **contoso_lifts_invoice** describe costs, prices, or \u201ccost and fees of the arbitration\u201d[1][2][3][6][7][8][9], but they do not define percentage\u2011based management fees, flat fee schedules, or deposits in the sense used above.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the only document that clearly uses both **percentage\u2011based fees** (commissions and markups) and **flat fees** (monthly charges, hourly charges, and a one\u2011time start\u2011up fee).[13][17]\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that uses a **deposit** concept, via an initial payment that is refundable only within a 3\u2011day cancellation window and otherwise forfeited.[4][5]\n- The **core difference**:\n  - Percentage\u2011based fees are **ongoing, variable compensation** tied to performance (rental income or repair spending).[13][17]\n  - Flat fees are **fixed charges** for ongoing administrative/advertising services and specific coordination tasks, plus a one\u2011time onboarding cost.[13][17]\n  - The deposit is an **upfront security/commitment payment** that affects the parties\u2019 rights upon cancellation, rather than a fee for ongoing services.[4][5]\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Which doc has a percentage\u2011based fee?**  \n  The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** uses percentage\u2011based fees: 25% and 10% commissions on gross rental revenues, 10% on repair charges, and 4.712% tax on those fees.[13][17]\n\n- **Which doc has a flat fee?**  \n  The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** also uses flat fees: $75/month advertising, $50/month administration/accounting, $35/hour scheduling/escort, and a $250 non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee.[13][17]\n\n- **Which doc has a deposit?**  \n  The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** uses a deposit concept: an initial payment due upon signing (functioning as a deposit) that is fully refundable if the customer cancels within 3 business days, but forfeited if cancellation occurs later.[4][5]\n\nIn terms of application: percentage\u2011based fees are calculated repeatedly based on revenues or costs; flat fees are fixed recurring or event\u2011based charges; and the deposit is a one\u2011time upfront payment whose main legal consequence is whether it is refunded or forfeited depending on the timing of cancellation.",

Afterward, **deposit is forfeited**.\u201d[4][5]\n\nWhile the contract does not label a specific line item as \u201cdeposit,\u201d it states that the contract is effective upon \u201cinitial payment\u201d[4][5] and then refers to \u201cdeposit\u201d in the cancellation clause, implying that the initial payment (or payments made by that time) function as a deposit that can be refunded if cancellation occurs within 3 business days, but is forfeited if cancellation occurs after that period.[4][5]\n\nNo other document uses the term \u201cdeposit\u201d or describes a payment in deposit\u2011like terms (timing, refundability, forfeiture) in the provided excerpts.\n\n### Q4 & Q8: How the documents differ in their \u201cfees\u201d concepts\n\nBringing the above together:\n\n1. **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n   - **Percentage\u2011based fees**:  \n     - 25% of gross revenues for short\u2011term/vacation rentals.[13][14][17]  \n     - 10% of gross revenues for long\u2011term leases.[13][14][17]  \n     - 10% of the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations.[13][14][17]  \n   - **Flat fees**:  \n     - $75.00/month advertising charge.[13][14][17]  \n     - $50.00/month minimum administration and accounting charge.[13][14][17]  \n     - $35/hour scheduling/escort charge.[13][14][17]  \n     - $250.00 non\u2011refundable agency start\u2011up fee.[13][14][17]  \n   - No deposit is mentioned.\n\n2. **purchase_contract**  \n   - Does **not** specify any percentage\u2011based fees.  \n   - Contains fixed contract price installments ($20,000, $7,000, $2,900) as payment terms, but these are not described as \u201cfees.\u201d[4][5]  \n   - **Deposit**: The contract is effective upon initial payment, and the \u201cRight to Cancel\u201d clause states that the customer may cancel within 3 business days for a full refund, but \u201cafterward, deposit is forfeited,\u201d clearly characterizing a deposit that is refundable within a short window and non\u2011refundable thereafter.[4][5]\n\n3. **contoso_lifts_invoice**  \n   - Lists fixed prices and totals for items (e.g., subtotal $29,900.00, tax N/A, total $29,900.00).[9]  \n   - No percentage\u2011based fees, no explicit \u201cfees\u201d line items, and no deposit language in the excerpt.[9]\n\n4. **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**  \n   - Mentions that \u201ceach party shall be responsible to pay for one\u2011half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration and their respective costs including attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d but does not specify percentages of revenues or fixed fee amounts; this is a cost\u2011sharing rule, not a defined fee schedule.[1][2][3][6][7][8]  \n   - No deposit is mentioned.\n\n5. **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**  \n   - States that the owner agrees \u201cto pay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper,\u201d but does not define those charges as percentages or fixed fees in the text provided.[12]  \n   - No deposit is mentioned.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Percentage\u2011based fee vs. flat fee**:  \n  Only the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** clearly uses percentage\u2011based fees (commissions and repair\u2011related fees) and also sets out multiple flat fees (monthly charges, hourly rate, start\u2011up fee).[13][14][17]  \n- **Deposit vs. fees**:  \n  The **purchase_contract** is the only document that clearly uses the concept of a **deposit**, tied to cancellation rights and forfeiture after a 3\u2011day period.[4][5] It does not define percentage\u2011based fees and does not label its fixed payments as \u201cfees.\u201d  \n- Other documents (warranty, holding tank contract, invoice) mention costs or prices but do not define structured \u201cfees\u201d as percentages, flat fee schedules, or deposits in the way the question targets.[1][2][3][6][7][8][9][12]\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- **Document with percentage\u2011based fees**:  \n  The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** has percentage\u2011based fees: 25% and 10% commissions on gross rental revenues and a 10% fee on total repair/upgrade charges.[13][14][17]\n\n- **Document with flat fees**:  \n  The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** also has flat fees: $75/month advertising, $50/month administration/accounting, $35/hour scheduling/escort, and a $250 non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee.[13][14][17]\n\n- **Document with a deposit**:  \n  The **purchase_contract** includes a deposit concept: the contract is effective upon initial payment, and the \u201cdeposit is forfeited\u201d if the customer cancels after 3 business days, whereas cancellation within 3 days yields a full refund.[4][5]\n\nNo other document in the provided context clearly defines percentage\u2011based fees, flat fee schedules, or deposits in this sense.",
