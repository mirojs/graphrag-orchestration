            "text_norm": " analysis  q1  q5  required notification channels for an emergency defect the builders limited warranty specifies two different channels depending on whether the issue is routine or an emergency: 1. standard nonemergency defects - must be reported in writing by letter sent by certified mail return receipt requested to the builders office address listed in the warranty.123 - this written notice is required prior to the termination of the one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable.123 2. emergency defects e.g. burst pipe - if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage for instance a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately.123 - the warranty states: only emergency reports will be taken by phone.123 thus for an emergency defect such as a burst pipe the required notification channel is telephone to the builders emergency number as designated in the warranty.123  q2  q6  time requirements / deadlines for notice for emergencies the warranty uses qualitative timing language: - the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately if an emergency exists or if delay will cause extra damage example given: a burst pipe.123 for the overall warranty claim including emergencies there is also a broader deadline: - any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered.23 so: - emergency timing: immediately by phone when the emergency occurs or is discovered.123 - overall claim timing: written claim must still be made within the applicable oneyear or 60day warranty period for coverage.23  q3  q7  consequences of delayed or untimely notification the warranty expressly addresses the consequence of failing to promptly report an emergency: - failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.123 additionally in the exclusions section: - the warranty excludes damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.23 combined these provisions mean: - if the owner does not promptly notify the builder of an emergency via the required phone call the builder has no liability for: - replacement - repair - any other damages related to that emergency.123 - even if some coverage might otherwise exist any additional damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are excluded from coverage.23 effectively delayed or missing emergency notification can result in loss of coverage for the emergency event and its resulting damages.123  q4  q8  conditions or exceptions affecting channel or consequences the warranty text does not provide explicit exceptions or special rules for: - owner absence - afterhours emergencies - circumstances beyond the owners control the operative language is categorical: - emergency: buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately.123 - only emergency reports will be taken by phone.123 - failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency  relieves the builder of all liability123 - exclusion for damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.23 no carveouts or mitigating conditions are stated. any argument about exceptions e.g. owner hospitalized unreachable phone etc. would have to be made outside the text of this warranty e.g. under general contract law or equity because the document itself does not provide them.  key connections - channel vs. urgency: - routine defects: written certifiedmail notice within the warranty period.123 - emergency defects: immediate telephone notice phone is expressly reserved for emergencies.123 - timing vs. coverage: - emergency must be reported immediately by phone failure to do so relieves the builder of all liability for that emergency.123 - regardless of emergency status the underlying claim must still be made in writing within the oneyear or 60day term or it is not covered.23 - delay vs. damages: - the warranty excludes damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification23 reinforcing that delay can reduce or eliminate coverage even if some liability might otherwise exist. - no textual exceptions: - the document does not soften these rules for special circumstances the obligations and consequences are stated in absolute terms.123  conclusion under the builders limited warranty if an emergency defect occurs during the warranty period such as a burst pipe the buyer/owner is required to telephone the builder immediately at the designated emergency number because only emergency reports will be taken by phone.123 failure to promptly provide this emergency phone notice relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages arising from that emergency and any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are expressly excluded from coverage.123",

            "text_norm": " analysis  q1  required notification channel and timing for an emergency defect e.g. burst pipe under the builders limited warranty the general rule is that defects must be reported in writing by certified mail to the builders office address before the warranty period expires.123 however there is a specific rule for emergencies: - if an emergency exists or if delay will cause extra damage example given: a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately.123 - the warranty states: only emergency reports will be taken by phone.123 thus for an emergency defect such as a burst pipe occurring under the warranty: - required channel: telephone call to the builders emergency number phone.123 - timing requirement: the call must be made immediately upon the emergency or when delay would cause extra damage.123 written notice is still required for nonemergency defects but emergencies are singled out for immediate phone notification. ---  q2  consequences of delay in using the required notification channel for an emergency defect the warranty expressly states: - failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.123 so if there is a delay in using the required notification channel telephone to report an emergency defect such as a burst pipe: - the builder is relieved of all liability: - no obligation to replace - no obligation to repair - no liability for any other damages related to that emergency.123 this is a complete loss of warranty coverage for that emergency event if notification is not prompt. ---  q3  distinction between emergency and nonemergency defects channels and consequences of delay the warranty draws a clear distinction: 1. notification channels: - nonemergency defects: must be reported in writing by certified mail to the builders office address within the applicable 1year or 60day warranty period.123 - emergency defects e.g. burst pipe: must be reported by telephone immediately only emergency reports will be taken by phone.123 2. consequences of delay: - nonemergency defects: - any claims not made in writing within the warranty period are not covered.23 - there is also a general exclusion for damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.23 - emergency defects: - specific clause: failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.123 thus emergencies have: - a different required channel phone vs. certified mail and - a specific harsher consequence for delay complete relief of liability for that emergency in addition to the general exclusion for avoidable damages.123 ---  q4  restating timing requirements for emergency notification for clarity and emphasis: - the warranty uses the term immediately for emergency phone notification: if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage for instance a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately.123 - it also uses promptly in describing the consequence: failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency123 so the timing requirement is: - immediate / prompt telephone notification upon occurrence of the emergency or when delay would cause extra damage.123 ---  q5  how delay affects handling and coverage of an emergency defect when there is a delay in using the required notification channel phone for an emergency defect: - the builder is relieved of all liability for: - replacement - repair - all other damages related to that emergency.123 in practical terms this means: - the emergency defect e.g. burst pipe may no longer be handled as a covered warranty claim at all. - the owner may have to bear the full cost of repair and any resulting damage because the warrantys obligation is extinguished for that emergency due to delayed notification.123 this is in addition to the general exclusion for damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder which applies to all defects.23 ---  q6  comparison of a notification channels and b consequences of delay for emergency vs. nonemergency defects a notification channels: - nonemergency defects: - required: written letter describing the defect sent by certified mail return receipt requested to the builders office address within the warranty period.123 - emergency defects e.g. burst pipe: - required: telephone call to the builder immediately only emergency reports will be taken by phone.123 b consequences of delay: - nonemergency defects: - claims not made in writing within the 1year or 60day period are not covered.23 - damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder are excluded from coverage.23 - emergency defects: - specific rule: failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.123 - this is a broader and more explicit forfeiture of coverage for that emergency event than the general exclusions. thus emergency defects are treated more strictly: they must be phoned in immediately and any lack of prompt notification can completely eliminate the builders obligations for that emergency.123 ---  key connections - the original query asks: if an emergency defect occurs under the warranty e.g. burst pipe what is the required notification channel and consequence of delay - from q1 and q4 we see the required channel and timing: immediate telephone notification for emergencies like a burst pipe.123 - from q2 and q5 we see the consequence of delay: the builder is relieved of all liability for replacement repair and other damages for that emergency.123 - from q3 and q6 we see how this differs from nonemergency defects which use certified mail and have general coverage cutoffs and exclusions but not this specific relieves the builder of all liability language for emergencies.123 together these points directly answer the original question by specifying both the communication method and the legal effect of failing to use it promptly. ---  conclusion under the builders limited warranty if an emergency defect such as a burst pipe occurs during the warranty period the buyer/owner is required to telephone the builder immediately to report the emergency only emergency reports are accepted by phone.123 if the buyer/owner fails to promptly provide this emergency phone notification the warranty states that the builder is relieved of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages arising from that emergency.123",

Only emergency reports will be taken by phone.”**[1][2][3]\n\nThus, for an emergency defect such as a burst pipe, the **required notification channel is a telephone call to the Builder’s emergency number** (listed as “Emergency Number (208) 555‑2311”).[1][2][3]\n\n### Q2 & Q6 – Time requirements or deadlines for using the emergency channel\n\nThe warranty does not give a fixed number of hours or days for emergency notice, but it does impose an immediacy requirement:\n\n- **“If an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage … the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately.”**[1][2][3]\n\n“Immediately” is the operative time requirement. There is no separate clock (e.g., 24 hours) defined; instead, the owner is obligated to call as soon as the emergency exists or as soon as it is apparent that delay will cause extra damage.[1][2][3]\n\nSeparately, all warranty claims (including those involving emergencies) must still be made **within the applicable warranty term** and **“in writing as provided herein”** (i.e., by certified mail) within one year or sixty days, as applicable, or they are not covered.[2][3] However, for the emergency aspect, the key timing requirement is the **immediate phone call**.\n\n### Q3 & Q7 – Consequences of delay in providing emergency notice\n\nThe warranty expressly states the consequence of failing to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency:\n\n- **“Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”**[1][2][3]\n\nAdditionally, in the exclusions section, the warranty excludes:\n\n- **“Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”**[2][3]\n\nTogether, these provisions mean that if the owner delays in using the required emergency notification (telephone) and that delay is not “prompt,” the Builder is contractually relieved of liability for:\n\n- Replacement  \n- Repair  \n- “All other damages” related to that emergency defect[1][2][3]\n\nand any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice are expressly excluded from coverage.[2][3]\n\n### Q4 & Q8 – Effect of delay on the owner’s rights to repairs, coverage, or compensation\n\nThe contract makes clear that delay in emergency notification directly affects the owner’s rights:\n\n1. **Complete loss of warranty liability for the emergency**  \n   The clause quoted above is categorical:  \n   - **“Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”**[1][2][3]  \n   This means that if the owner does not promptly call the Builder when an emergency (e.g., burst pipe) occurs, the Builder has **no obligation** under the warranty to:\n   - Repair the emergency defect  \n   - Replace affected components  \n   - Pay or compensate for any resulting damages[1][2][3]\n\n2. **Exclusion of avoidable damages**  \n   Even apart from the emergency‑specific clause, the exclusions section removes coverage for:  \n   - **“Damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the Builder.”**[2][3]  \n   So, any additional damage that occurs because the owner did not promptly notify the Builder is not covered, even if some underlying defect might otherwise have been within the warranty.\n\n3. **Interaction with general written‑notice requirement**  \n   All claims must still be made **in writing** within the applicable warranty period or they are not covered at all:  \n   - **“ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.”**[2][3]  \n   For an emergency, this means:\n   - The owner must **immediately telephone** the Builder to preserve emergency coverage.[1][2][3]  \n   - The owner must also **submit written notice by certified mail within the warranty term** to preserve the underlying warranty claim generally.[1][2][3]\n\nIf the owner fails to promptly call, the emergency‑related rights (repair, replacement, damages) are forfeited; if the owner also fails to send timely written notice within the warranty period, the entire claim is outside coverage.[1][2][3]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Channel vs. timing:**  \n  The contract distinguishes **how** to report (phone for emergencies, certified mail for all claims) from **when** to report (immediately for emergencies; within 1 year or 60 days for overall warranty claims).[1][2][3]\n- **Emergency notice as a condition of coverage:**  \n  Prompt telephone notice is not just a procedural preference; it is expressly made a **condition** of the Builder’s liability for emergency defects.[1][2][3]\n- **Delay directly limits rights:**  \n  The combination of the emergency clause and the exclusions section means that delay in using the required emergency channel both:\n  - Relieves the Builder of all liability for that emergency event, and  \n  - Excludes any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice.[1][2][3]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Builders Limited Warranty, if an emergency defect occurs (such as a burst pipe), the owner is required to **telephone the Builder immediately** at the listed emergency number; only emergency reports are accepted by phone.[1][2][3] Prompt telephone notice is a condition of coverage: **failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages**, and any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are excluded from coverage.[1][2][3]",
            "text_norm": " analysis  q1  q5  required notification channels for an emergency defect the builders limited warranty specifies two different channels depending on whether the issue is routine or an emergency: - for nonemergency defects the owner must write a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the builders office address.123 - for emergencies the contract creates a separate specific requirement: if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage for instance a defective pipe has burst the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately. only emergency reports will be taken by phone.123 thus for an emergency defect such as a burst pipe the required notification channel is a telephone call to the builders emergency number listed as emergency number 208 5552311.123  q2  q6  time requirements or deadlines for using the emergency channel the warranty does not give a fixed number of hours or days for emergency notice but it does impose an immediacy requirement: - if an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage  the buyer/owner must telephone the builder immediately.123 immediately is the operative time requirement. there is no separate clock e.g. 24 hours defined instead the owner is obligated to call as soon as the emergency exists or as soon as it is apparent that delay will cause extra damage.123 separately all warranty claims including those involving emergencies must still be made within the applicable warranty term and in writing as provided herein i.e. by certified mail within one year or sixty days as applicable or they are not covered.23 however for the emergency aspect the key timing requirement is the immediate phone call.  q3  q7  consequences of delay in providing emergency notice the warranty expressly states the consequence of failing to promptly notify the builder of an emergency: - failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.123 additionally in the exclusions section the warranty excludes: - damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.23 together these provisions mean that if the owner delays in using the required emergency notification telephone and that delay is not prompt the builder is contractually relieved of liability for: - replacement - repair - all other damages related to that emergency defect123 and any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice are expressly excluded from coverage.23  q4  q8  effect of delay on the owners rights to repairs coverage or compensation the contract makes clear that delay in emergency notification directly affects the owners rights: 1. complete loss of warranty liability for the emergency the clause quoted above is categorical: - failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages.123 this means that if the owner does not promptly call the builder when an emergency e.g. burst pipe occurs the builder has no obligation under the warranty to: - repair the emergency defect - replace affected components - pay or compensate for any resulting damages123 2. exclusion of avoidable damages even apart from the emergencyspecific clause the exclusions section removes coverage for: - damages which could have been avoided by prompt notification to the builder.23 so any additional damage that occurs because the owner did not promptly notify the builder is not covered even if some underlying defect might otherwise have been within the warranty. 3. interaction with general writtennotice requirement all claims must still be made in writing within the applicable warranty period or they are not covered at all: - any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered.23 for an emergency this means: - the owner must immediately telephone the builder to preserve emergency coverage.123 - the owner must also submit written notice by certified mail within the warranty term to preserve the underlying warranty claim generally.123 if the owner fails to promptly call the emergencyrelated rights repair replacement damages are forfeited if the owner also fails to send timely written notice within the warranty period the entire claim is outside coverage.123  key connections - channel vs. timing: the contract distinguishes how to report phone for emergencies certified mail for all claims from when to report immediately for emergencies within 1 year or 60 days for overall warranty claims.123 - emergency notice as a condition of coverage: prompt telephone notice is not just a procedural preference it is expressly made a condition of the builders liability for emergency defects.123 - delay directly limits rights: the combination of the emergency clause and the exclusions section means that delay in using the required emergency channel both: - relieves the builder of all liability for that emergency event and - excludes any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notice.123  conclusion under the builders limited warranty if an emergency defect occurs such as a burst pipe the owner is required to telephone the builder immediately at the listed emergency number only emergency reports are accepted by phone.123 prompt telephone notice is a condition of coverage: failure to promptly notify the builder of an emergency relieves the builder of all liability for replacement repair and all other damages and any damages that could have been avoided by prompt notification are excluded from coverage.123",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1. How are “confirmed reservations” defined and identified at termination or sale?\n\nThe Property Management Agreement mentions “confirmed reservations” only once, in the TERM clause:\n\n> “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf. Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent. **In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.**” [1]\n\nThe agreement does **not** provide an explicit definition section for “confirmed reservations,” nor does it spell out a formal identification mechanism (e.g., “reservations for which a deposit has been paid”). Instead, “confirmed reservations” is used in its ordinary sense, referring to reservations that have already been finalized/accepted by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf as “existing rental agreements” at the time of termination or sale. This is inferred because the sentence about confirmed reservations immediately follows the statement that termination does not invalidate “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [1]\n\nSo, at the time of termination or sale, “confirmed reservations” are effectively those existing rental agreements already made by the Agent for the property.\n\n### Q2. What clauses address confirmed reservations if the agreement is terminated?\n\nThe relevant clause is in the TERM section:\n\n- **TERM clause**:  \n  - Either party may terminate on 60 days’ written notice. [1]  \n  - “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [1]  \n  - “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [1]  \n  - “In the event this agreement is terminated … the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nThere is no separate “survival” or “reservation handling” section; the treatment of reservations on termination is entirely contained in this TERM clause. [1]\n\n### Q3. What clauses address confirmed reservations if the property is sold?\n\nThe same TERM clause also addresses the sale scenario:\n\n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, **or the property is sold**, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nThere is no separate “sale of property” or “assignment and successors” clause elaborating on reservations; the only explicit rule is that the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations when the property is sold. [1]\n\nThe GOVERNING LAW clause notes that the Agreement “shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent,” [1] which implies that obligations (including honoring confirmed reservations) can bind successors/assignees, but it does not add specific reservation mechanics beyond the TERM clause.\n\n### Q4. Who is responsible for honoring/canceling/modifying confirmed reservations after termination or sale?\n\nResponsibility is placed on the **Owner**:\n\n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [1]\n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, **the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.**” [1]\n\nThe agreement does **not** authorize the Agent to cancel or modify confirmed reservations upon termination or sale; instead, it explicitly preserves those reservations and shifts ongoing responsibility to the Owner (or the Owner’s successors/assignees, via the binding-on-successors clause). [1]\n\nThus:\n- Honoring confirmed reservations: Owner’s obligation. [1]\n- Canceling/modifying: Not expressly addressed; the only clear directive is that they must be honored, which implies they are not to be unilaterally canceled simply because of termination or sale. [1]\n\n### Q5. How are payments, fees, or refunds related to confirmed reservations handled after termination or sale?\n\nThe agreement sets out general financial arrangements but does **not** create a special, detailed mechanism for payments/refunds tied specifically to confirmed reservations after termination or sale.\n\nRelevant provisions:\n\n- Agent collects all rents and deposits them in a trust account; Owner receives monthly statements and distributions of amounts available. [1]\n- Agent’s fees are defined as percentages of gross revenues and various charges (commissions, advertising, admin, repair coordination, etc.). [1][2][3]\n- Upon termination, “Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [1]\n\nFrom this:\n\n- Any obligations or expenses the Agent has already incurred in connection with confirmed reservations (e.g., advertising, housekeeping, maintenance, credit card fees) remain the Owner’s responsibility even after termination. [1]\n- The agreement does **not** explicitly address:\n  - How prepaid guest funds are to be transferred or held after termination.\n  - How refunds to guests should be processed if a reservation is later canceled for reasons other than termination/sale.\n  - Any special reallocation of commissions or fees for stays that occur after termination but were booked before termination.\n\nTherefore, the only clear rule is that the Owner remains financially responsible for obligations and expenses already incurred by the Agent, and must honor the reservations themselves; the document is silent on detailed refund mechanics in this context. [1]\n\n### Q6. Across the corpus, how are “confirmed reservations” defined/identified at termination or sale (without double-counting sections)?\n\nAcross all occurrences of the Property Management Agreement in the corpus, the only substantive treatment of “confirmed reservations” is the single sentence in the TERM clause:\n\n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nThe other “PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT” snippets in the corpus are duplicative fee/boilerplate sections and do not add any definition or identification criteria for “confirmed reservations.” [2][3]\n\nThus, considering the corpus as a whole (and treating repeated sections as one agreement), “confirmed reservations” are:\n\n- Not formally defined in a definitions section.\n- Identified implicitly as those existing rental agreements made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf at the time of termination or sale, which must be honored by the Owner. [1]\n\nNo other document (e.g., the Builder’s Limited Warranty or Holding Tank Servicing Contract) adds any content about “confirmed reservations” in relation to the Property Management Agreement. [4][5][7][9]\n\n### Q7. What clauses collectively describe what happens to confirmed reservations on termination or sale?\n\nCollectively, the relevant clauses in the Property Management Agreement are:\n\n1. **TERM clause** (core rule):  \n   - Termination on 60 days’ written notice. [1]  \n   - Termination does not invalidate existing rental agreements made by Agent. [1]  \n   - Owner remains responsible for obligations/expenses incurred by Agent. [1]  \n   - On termination or sale, Owner must honor all confirmed reservations. [1]\n\n2. **GOVERNING LAW / successors clause**:  \n   - “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.” [1]  \n   This supports the idea that the obligation to honor confirmed reservations can follow the Owner’s successors (e.g., a buyer), though it is not spelled out in detail.\n\nTaken together, these clauses describe a consistent treatment:\n\n- Confirmed reservations (existing rental agreements) survive termination of the management agreement and survive a sale of the property. [1]\n- The Owner (and potentially successors/assignees) must honor those reservations and remain responsible for obligations and expenses already incurred by the Agent in relation to them. [1]\n\nNo other clauses in the agreement modify or contradict this treatment.\n\n### Q8. Roles/appearances of “property management agreement” in relation to confirmed reservations across the corpus\n\nConsidering the corpus as a whole (without counting repeated sections as separate agreements), the “Property Management Agreement” plays these distinct roles regarding confirmed reservations:\n\n1. **Source of the obligation**:  \n   It is the contract that creates the Owner’s duty to honor confirmed reservations upon termination or sale. [1]\n\n2. **Context for identification**:  \n   It frames “confirmed reservations” as “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf,” which are preserved despite termination. [1]\n\n3. **Allocation of post-termination responsibility**:  \n   It assigns ongoing responsibility for obligations and expenses (including those tied to confirmed reservations) to the Owner after termination. [1]\n\n4. **Instrument binding successors**:  \n   Through the “binding upon successors and assigns” language, it potentially extends the obligation to honor confirmed reservations to future owners or assignees, though without detailed mechanics. [1]\n\nOther documents in the corpus (Builder’s Limited Warranty, Holding Tank Servicing Contract) do not alter or supplement these roles; they concern different subject matter and do not address confirmed reservations under the Property Management Agreement. [4][5][7][9]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Definition/Identification (Q1 & Q6)**: “Confirmed reservations” are not formally defined but are implicitly the existing rental agreements made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf at the time of termination or sale. [1]\n- **Substantive Treatment (Q2, Q3 & Q7)**: The TERM clause is the central provision, stating that termination does not invalidate existing rental agreements and that the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations when the agreement is terminated or the property is sold. [1]\n- **Responsibility (Q4 & Q8)**: Responsibility for honoring these reservations and for obligations/expenses incurred by the Agent rests with the Owner (and potentially successors/assignees). [1]\n- **Financial Handling (Q5)**: The agreement preserves the Owner’s responsibility for obligations and expenses already incurred but does not provide a special, detailed scheme for reallocating payments, fees, or refunds tied specifically to confirmed reservations after termination or sale. [1][2][3]\n\nAll of these points converge on a single principle: confirmed reservations survive both termination of the management agreement and sale of the property, and the Owner remains on the hook to fulfill them.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, existing rental agreements made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf—i.e., “confirmed reservations”—are not invalidated, and the Owner is obligated to honor all such confirmed reservations and remain responsible for obligations and expenses the Agent has incurred in connection with them.

Roles/appearances of “property management agreement” in relation to confirmed reservations across the corpus\n\nConsidering the corpus as a whole (without counting repeated sections as separate agreements), the “Property Management Agreement” plays these distinct roles regarding confirmed reservations:\n\n1. **Source of the obligation**:  \n   It is the contract that creates the Owner’s duty to honor confirmed reservations upon termination or sale. [1]\n\n2. **Context for identification**:  \n   It frames “confirmed reservations” as “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner’s behalf,” which are preserved despite termination. [1]\n\n3. **Allocation of post-termination responsibility**:  \n   It assigns ongoing responsibility for obligations and expenses (including those tied to confirmed reservations) to the Owner after termination. [1]\n\n4. **Instrument binding successors**:  \n   Through the “binding upon successors and assigns” language, it potentially extends the obligation to honor confirmed reservations to future owners or assignees, though without detailed mechanics. [1]\n\nOther documents in the corpus (Builder’s Limited Warranty, Holding Tank Servicing Contract) do not alter or supplement these roles; they concern different subject matter and do not address confirmed reservations under the Property Management Agreement. [4][5][7][9]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Definition/Identification (Q1 & Q6)**: “Confirmed reservations” are not formally defined but are implicitly the existing rental agreements made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf at the time of termination or sale. [1]\n- **Substantive Treatment (Q2, Q3 & Q7)**: The TERM clause is the central provision, stating that termination does not invalidate existing rental agreements and that the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations when the agreement is terminated or the property is sold. [1]\n- **Responsibility (Q4 & Q8)**: Responsibility for honoring these reservations and for obligations/expenses incurred by the Agent rests with the Owner (and potentially successors/assignees). [1]\n- **Financial Handling (Q5)**: The agreement preserves the Owner’s responsibility for obligations and expenses already incurred but does not provide a special, detailed scheme for reallocating payments, fees, or refunds tied specifically to confirmed reservations after termination or sale. [1][2][3]\n\nAll of these points converge on a single principle: confirmed reservations survive both termination of the management agreement and sale of the property, and the Owner remains on the hook to fulfill them.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, existing rental agreements made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf—i.e., “confirmed reservations”—are not invalidated, and the Owner is obligated to honor all such confirmed reservations and remain responsible for obligations and expenses the Agent has incurred in connection with them.

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1: How are “confirmed reservations” defined and identified at termination or sale?\n\nThe Property Management Agreement does not provide an explicit definition of “confirmed reservations” or a special mechanism for identifying them at the moment of termination or sale. The relevant language appears in the TERM clause:\n\n> “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf. Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent. **In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.**” [1]\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are those rental agreements that have already been made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf before termination or sale (“existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf” [1]).\n- The agreement treats “existing rental agreements” and “confirmed reservations” as the operative category of bookings that survive termination or sale, but it does not spell out operational criteria (e.g., deposit paid, written confirmation) beyond being an “existing rental agreement” at that time [1].\n\nThus, identification is by status: any rental agreement already entered into by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf at the time of termination or sale is treated as a “confirmed reservation” that must be honored [1].\n\n---\n\n### Q2: What happens to those reservations (honored, canceled, transferred)?\n\nThe agreement is clear that such reservations are not canceled by termination and must be honored:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [1]\n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nFrom this:\n\n- Existing/confirmed reservations are **not canceled** by termination of the management agreement [1].\n- The Owner is obligated to **honor** all confirmed reservations in both scenarios (termination or sale) [1].\n- The agreement does not expressly discuss “transfer” of reservations to a new manager; instead, it places the obligation directly on the Owner to honor them, regardless of who manages the property afterward [1].\n\nSo, the contractual treatment is: confirmed reservations survive termination/sale and must be honored by the Owner; there is no contractual basis in this document for canceling them due to termination or sale, nor any detailed transfer mechanism to a new manager [1].\n\n---\n\n### Q3: What clauses address confirmed reservations if the property is sold?\n\nThe same TERM clause addresses the sale of the property:\n\n> “In the event this agreement is terminated, **or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.**” [1]\n\nKey points:\n\n- The clause explicitly covers the **sale of the property** as a separate trigger, alongside termination [1].\n- It imposes a direct obligation on the Owner to **honor all confirmed reservations** after the sale [1].\n- There is no separate “assignment and assumption” or “successor owner obligations” clause; instead, the agreement states more generally that:\n  - “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.” [1]\n- That binding-on-successors language means that, as between the contracting parties and their successors/assigns, the obligations under the agreement—including the obligation to honor confirmed reservations—run with successors and assigns of the Owner or Agent [1]. However, the document does not detail the mechanics of how a new owner or manager would assume those obligations; it simply states that the Owner must ensure confirmed reservations are honored [1].\n\nThus, the specific operative clause for a sale is the sentence in the TERM section requiring the Owner to honor all confirmed reservations when the property is sold [1].\n\n---\n\n### Q4: Are confirmed reservations treated differently for termination vs. sale?\n\nThe agreement treats termination of the management agreement and sale of the property in largely parallel ways with respect to confirmed reservations:\n\n1. **On termination of the management agreement:**\n   - “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [1]\n   - “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [1]\n   - “In the event this agreement is terminated … the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\n   Effects:\n   - Existing/confirmed reservations remain valid and enforceable.\n   - The Owner remains responsible for obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent, which would include obligations under those rental agreements [1].\n   - The Owner must honor all confirmed reservations [1].\n\n2. **On sale of the property:**\n   - The same sentence applies: “In the event this agreement is terminated, **or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.**” [1]\n\n   Effects:\n   - The Owner is still obligated to ensure all confirmed reservations are honored after the sale [1].\n   - The agreement does not add any different or additional treatment for reservations upon sale (e.g., no separate cancellation or renegotiation right is provided) [1].\n\n3. **Differences:**\n   - The agreement adds extra language about obligations and expenses “upon termination” (continuing responsibility for obligations/expenses incurred by the Agent) [1], but it does not repeat that language specifically for a sale.\n   - However, with respect to **confirmed reservations themselves**, the treatment is the same: in both cases, the Owner must honor all confirmed reservations [1].\n\nSo, regarding confirmed reservations, there is **no substantive difference** in treatment between termination and sale: in both scenarios, confirmed reservations survive and must be honored by the Owner [1]. The only nuance is that the “obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent” language is expressly tied to termination, not separately to sale [1], but that does not change the requirement to honor confirmed reservations in either case.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The TERM clause is the central provision for all sub-questions: it simultaneously addresses termination, existing rental agreements, and the sale of the property, and it imposes the obligation to honor confirmed reservations in both scenarios [1].\n- “Confirmed reservations” are functionally the same as “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf” at the time of termination or sale; these are the bookings that survive and must be honored [1].\n- Termination of the management agreement affects the relationship between Owner and Agent (e.g., ongoing responsibility for obligations/expenses incurred by the Agent) but explicitly does **not** invalidate existing rental agreements [1].\n- Sale of the property is treated in parallel to termination regarding confirmed reservations: in both cases, the Owner must ensure those reservations are honored, and the agreement is binding on successors and assigns [1].\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the management agreement is terminated or the property is sold, any existing rental agreements that the Agent has already made on the Owner’s behalf—i.e., “confirmed reservations”—remain valid and must be honored. Termination “does not invalidate any existing rental agreements” [1], and in both situations (termination or sale) “the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations” [1]. The agreement does not authorize cancellation of those reservations due to termination or sale, nor does it detail a transfer mechanism to a new manager; instead, it places the continuing obligation on the Owner (and, by the binding-on-successors clause, on successors/assigns) to ensure those confirmed reservations are fulfilled [1].",

The only relevant language appears in the TERM clause:\n\n> “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf. Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent. In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nFrom this, we can infer:\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are those that have resulted in “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf” as of the time of termination or sale. [1]\n- The agreement assumes such reservations are already in place (i.e., “existing rental agreements”) but does not spell out operational criteria (e.g., deposit paid, written confirmation) for what counts as “confirmed.” [1]\n\nSo, identification is implicit: any rental agreement already made by the Agent for the property at the time of termination or sale would be treated as a “confirmed reservation,” but the contract does not define the term further. [1]\n\n---\n\n### Q2: What happens to those reservations (honored, canceled, transferred) and who is responsible?\n\nThe TERM clause directly addresses the effect of termination and sale on existing/confirmed reservations:\n\n- “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [1]\n- “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [1]\n- “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nFrom this:\n\n- Existing/confirmed reservations are **not canceled** by termination of the management agreement. They remain valid rental agreements. [1]\n- The Owner must **honor** all confirmed reservations, both when:\n  - the agreement is terminated, and\n  - the property is sold. [1]\n- Responsibility to fulfill those reservations lies with the **Owner**, who must either:\n  - personally perform/allow performance of the obligations, or\n  - “cause to be completed” those obligations (e.g., via a new manager or buyer). [1]\n\nThe agreement does **not** expressly state that reservations are “transferred” to a buyer or to a new agent; instead, it places the obligation squarely on the Owner to ensure they are honored. [1]\n\n---\n\n### Q3: What clauses address confirmed reservations if the property is sold, and does the buyer assume responsibility?\n\nThe same TERM clause is the specific provision that addresses the sale of the property:\n\n> “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nKey points:\n\n- The clause explicitly covers the scenario “the property is sold.” [1]\n- It requires that “the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations” in that event. [1]\n- The agreement is **silent** on:\n  - whether confirmed reservations are automatically assigned or transferred to the buyer; and\n  - whether the buyer is contractually obligated under this agreement to assume responsibility for those reservations.\n\nBecause the agreement states it is binding on “successors and assigns of Owner or Agent” [1], it is possible that, as a matter of contract law, obligations could bind successors, but the text does not explicitly say that the buyer must assume the reservations or how that assumption occurs. The only clear contractual obligation in this document is that the **Owner** must ensure confirmed reservations are honored when the property is sold. [1]\n\n---\n\n### Q4: How are confirmed reservations handled if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold?\n\nHandling is described in two linked sentences in the TERM clause:\n\n1. “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [1]  \n2. “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nThus, in both scenarios:\n\n- **Reservations remain valid**: Termination of the management agreement does not cancel or invalidate existing rental agreements. [1]\n- **Owner’s continuing obligations**:\n  - Upon termination, “Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [1]\n  - When the property is sold, the Owner must still “honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nOperationally, that means:\n\n- Guests with confirmed reservations should still be allowed to stay under the terms of their rental agreements, regardless of the management agreement ending or the property changing hands. [1]\n- The Owner must ensure performance (either directly, via a new manager, or via arrangements with the buyer), but the mechanism is not detailed. [1]\n\n---\n\n### Q5: Are there differences between termination and sale, and how are they described?\n\nThe agreement treats termination and sale similarly with respect to confirmed reservations:\n\n- The same sentence covers both: “In the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.” [1]\n\nDifferences in treatment:\n\n- **Termination-specific language**:\n  - “Termination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [1]\n  - “Upon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.” [1]\n- **Sale-specific language**:\n  - The sale is only mentioned in the phrase “or the property is sold” in connection with the Owner’s duty to honor confirmed reservations. [1]\n  - There is no parallel sentence about obligations/expenses “upon sale”; the focus is solely on honoring confirmed reservations. [1]\n\nSo:\n\n- For **termination**, the agreement explicitly preserves rental agreements and continues the Owner’s responsibility for obligations and expenses incurred by the Agent. [1]\n- For **sale**, the agreement explicitly requires the Owner to honor confirmed reservations but does not separately address other obligations/expenses or the buyer’s role. [1]\n- In both cases, the outcome for confirmed reservations is the same: they must be honored by the Owner. [1]\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- “Confirmed reservations” are not defined, but are functionally treated as “existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.” [1]\n- Termination of the management agreement does not cancel those rental agreements; they remain in force. [1]\n- Whether the agreement ends by **termination** or the property is **sold**, the Owner has a contractual duty to honor all confirmed reservations. [1]\n- The agreement does not expressly transfer obligations to a buyer; instead, it keeps the obligation on the Owner to ensure those reservations are honored, even in a sale scenario. [1]\n- The document is binding on successors and assigns, but the text does not detail how a buyer’s assumption of reservations is implemented; that would need to be handled outside this agreement (e.g., in the sale contract). [1]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder the Property Management Agreement, if the agreement is terminated or the property is sold, existing/confirmed reservations (i.e., existing rental agreements made by the Agent on the Owner’s behalf) remain valid and must be honored. Termination does not invalidate those rental agreements, and the Owner remains responsible to fulfill or cause fulfillment of all obligations and expenses incurred, including honoring all confirmed reservations in both termination and sale scenarios. The agreement does not explicitly state that reservations are transferred to a buyer or that the buyer assumes responsibility; it places the obligation on the Owner to ensure that all confirmed reservations are honored when the agreement ends or the property is sold.

What are all the explicitly stated day-based time windows mentioned?\n\nFrom the corpus, the following explicit day-based windows appear:\n\n1. **Sixty (60) days – Builder’s Limited Warranty (coverage for certain items)**  \n   - “The Builder warrants … for a period of sixty (60) days that the following items will be free of defects…”[1][12][13]\n\n2. **One (1) year and sixty (60) days – overall warranty terms and claim deadline**  \n   - “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement.”[3][4]  \n   - “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING … WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE … ARE NOT COVERED.”[3][4]  \n   (These are year-based but explicitly tied to “sixty (60) days” as an alternative window.)\n\n3. **Sixty (60) days – time to complete repairs**  \n   - “The Builder will repair or replace it at no charge … within sixty (60) days (longer if weather conditions, labor problems, or materials shortages cause delays).”[1][3][4]\n\n4. **Not more than 60 days – deadline to demand arbitration after service of a pleading**  \n   - “Upon the demand of a party … made before the institution of any judicial proceeding or not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross-claim or counterclaim…”[1][3][4]\n\n5. **180 days – target to conclude arbitration**  \n   - “The Parties agree … to take any action necessary to conclude an arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator.”[9][10][11]\n\n6. **Three (3) business days – right to cancel purchase contract**  \n   - “Customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited.”[2][6]\n\n7. **Five (5) business days – owner’s notice to agent if property is listed for sale**  \n   - “Provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.”[5]\n\n8. **Sixty (60) days – notice to terminate property management agreement**  \n   - “Either party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement.”[5]\n\n9. **Ten (10) business days – deadline to file changes to holding tank service contract**  \n   - “…the owner agrees to file a copy of any changes to this service contract or a copy of a new service contract with the municipality and the County named above within ten (10) business days from the date of change…”[14]\n\n---\n\n### Q4. For each explicitly stated day-based time window, what is its specific length in days?\n\nSummarizing the lengths:\n\n1. **60 days** – warranty coverage for certain items (doors, windows, etc.)[1][12][13]  \n2. **60 days** – alternative warranty term and claim deadline (paired with 1 year)[3][4]  \n3. **60 days** – time for builder to complete repairs[1][3][4]  \n4. **≤60 days** – latest time to demand arbitration after service of a complaint or similar pleading[1][3][4]  \n5. **180 days** – target duration to conclude arbitration[9][10][11]  \n6. **3 business days** – cancellation period for the lift purchase contract[2][6]  \n7. **5 business days** – owner’s deadline to notify agent of a listing agreement[5]  \n8. **60 days** – notice period to terminate the property management agreement[5]  \n9. **10 business days** – deadline to file changes to the holding tank service contract[14]\n\n---\n\n### Q5. For each explicitly stated day-based time window, what is its stated purpose and context?\n\n1. **60 days – warranty coverage for specific items**  \n   - Purpose: Short-term warranty that certain components (doors, windows, switches, fixtures, caulking, cabinet work) are free from defects.[1][12][13]  \n   - Context: Builder’s Limited Warranty; applies to non-structural items.\n\n2. **1 year / 60 days – overall warranty term and claim deadline**  \n   - Purpose: Defines when warranty coverage ends and by when claims must be made in writing.[3][4]  \n   - Context: Structural items covered for 1 year; certain items for 60 days; claims must be submitted within the applicable period.\n\n3. **60 days – time to complete repairs**  \n   - Purpose: Timeframe for the builder to repair or replace covered defects after written notice.[1][3][4]  \n   - Context: Service performance obligation under the warranty, extendable for weather, labor, or material issues.\n\n4. **≤60 days – deadline to demand arbitration after service of a pleading**  \n   - Purpose: Limits when a party can demand arbitration relative to litigation filings.[1][3][4]  \n   - Context: Arbitration clause in the Builder’s Limited Warranty; governs dispute resolution timing.\n\n5. **180 days – target to conclude arbitration**  \n   - Purpose: Encourages timely completion of arbitration proceedings; arbitrator may impose sanctions for delay.[9][10][11]  \n   - Context: Arbitration program under the Builder’s Limited Warranty.\n\n6. **3 business days – right to cancel purchase contract**  \n   - Purpose: Cooling-off period during which the customer can cancel and receive a full refund; after that, deposit is forfeited.[2][6]  \n   - Context: Consumer protection in the lift purchase contract.\n\n7. **5 business days – owner’s notice to agent of listing agreement**  \n   - Purpose: Ensures the agent is promptly informed if the property is listed for sale.[5]  \n   - Context: Owner’s obligations under the Property Management Agreement.\n\n8. **60 days – notice to terminate property management agreement**  \n   - Purpose: Advance written notice required by either party to end the management relationship.[5]  \n   - Context: Term and termination clause for ongoing property management.\n\n9. **10 business days – filing changes to holding tank service contract**  \n   - Purpose: Deadline for the owner to file any changes or a new service contract with the municipality and county.[14]  \n   - Context: Regulatory compliance under the Holding Tank Servicing Contract.\n\n---\n\n### Q6.

Integrated view while listing all explicit day-based windows\n\n- The documents collectively use **3**, **5**, **10** business days, **60** days (in several roles), and **180** days as explicit day-based windows.[1][2][3][4][5][6][9][10][11][12][13][14]  \n- These windows differ in **length** (from a few business days to six months) and in **purpose** (consumer cancellation, notice, warranty coverage, repairs, arbitration, regulatory filings).  \n- They align in that:\n  - Short windows are used for **immediate actions** (cancellation, notices, filings).[2][5][14]  \n  - 60-day windows are used for **substantive operational/legal processes** (warranty, repairs, arbitration demand, contract termination).[1][3][4][5]  \n  - 180 days is used for **full dispute resolution** (arbitration).[9][10][11]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Repeated 60-day motif:**  \n  60 days appears across different documents and contexts: warranty coverage, repair completion, arbitration demand, and termination notice.[1][3][4][5] This suggests a common “standard” medium-length operational/legal window.\n\n- **Business days vs. calendar days:**  \n  Shorter windows are explicitly in **business days** (3, 5, 10) for practical administrative actions.[2][5][14] The 60- and 180-day windows are expressed simply in days, fitting longer, more substantive processes.[1][3][4][9][10][11]\n\n- **Lifecycle coverage:**  \n  - Initial consumer decision: 3 business days to cancel a purchase.[2][6]  \n  - Ongoing relationship: 5 business days to notify of listing; 60 days to terminate management.[5]  \n  - Warranty phase: 60 days or 1 year coverage and claim deadlines; 60 days to repair.[1][3][4][12][13]  \n  - Dispute phase: up to 60 days to invoke arbitration; 180 days to conclude it.[1][3][4][9][10][11]  \n  - Regulatory updates: 10 business days to file contract changes.[14]\n\nTogether, these windows form a coherent timing framework across contracts and warranties.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the provided contracts and agreements, the explicit day-based time windows are:\n\n- **3 business days** – customer’s right to cancel the lift purchase contract for a full refund.[2][6]  \n- **5 business days** – owner’s deadline to notify the property manager of a listing agreement.[5]  \n- **10 business days** – owner’s deadline to file changes to the holding tank service contract with authorities.[14]  \n- **60 days** –  \n  - warranty coverage period for specified non-structural items;[1][12][13]  \n  - alternative warranty term and claim deadline (paired with 1 year);[3][4]  \n  - time for the builder to complete repairs;[1][3][4]  \n  - outer limit to demand arbitration after service of a complaint or similar pleading;[1][3][4]  \n  - notice period to terminate the property management agreement.[5]  \n- **180 days** – target period to conclude arbitration proceedings.[9][10][11]\n\nThese windows differ in length and purpose but align in pattern: short business-day windows for immediate administrative or consumer actions, 60-day windows for substantive operational and legal processes, and a 180-day window for full dispute resolution.",

Afterward, deposit is forfeited.”[2][6]\n\n#### Property Management Agreement\n\n1. **Initial term and renewals**  \n   - Agreement is “for an initial period of twelve months … and shall be automatically renewed for successive one year terms thereafter.”[5]  \n   (Year‑based, but clearly a day‑bounded term.)\n\n2. **Termination notice**  \n   - “Either party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement.”[5]\n\n3. **Owner notice of listing for sale**  \n   - Owner must “Provide Agent with written notification within five (5) business days of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.”[5]\n\n4. **Short‑term vs long‑term rental thresholds**  \n   - Short‑term/vacation rentals: “reservations of less than 180 days.”[7][8]  \n   - Long‑term leases: “leases of more than 180 days.”[7][8]\n\n#### Holding Tank Servicing Contract\n\n1. **Filing changes to contract**  \n   - If the contract changes, the owner must file a copy of the changes or new contract “within ten (10) business days from the date of change to this service contract.”[14]\n\n#### Arbitration Program (within Builders Limited Warranty)\n\n(Partly covered above, but summarized here for completeness.)\n\n1. **Arbitration demand deadline**  \n   - Demand for arbitration must be made “not more than 60 days after service of a complaint, third party complaint, cross‑claim or counterclaim or any answer thereto or any amendment to any of the above.”[1][3][4]\n\n2. **Target completion of arbitration**  \n   - Parties agree “to conclude an arbitration hereunder within 180 days of the filing of a Dispute with the Administrator,” with arbitrators empowered to impose sanctions for failure to proceed within these times.[9][10][11]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Short vs long warranty windows (Builder vs Lift Contractor)**  \n  - Builder: 60‑day warranty for certain finish items and 1‑year warranty for major systems.[1][12][13]  \n  - Lift contractor: 90‑day labor warranty.[2][6]  \n  These define different short‑term protection windows (60 vs 90 days) and a longer 1‑year structural window.\n\n- **Claim / action deadlines vs service windows**  \n  - Builder requires written claims within the applicable 60‑day or 1‑year period, or they are not covered.[3][4]  \n  - After a claim, Builder has 60 days to complete repairs (subject to delays).[1][3][4]  \n  - Arbitration related to disputes must be initiated within 60 days of service of pleadings and is intended to be completed within 180 days of filing.[1][3][4][9][10][11]  \n  This creates a chain of time windows: warranty term → claim deadline → repair window → arbitration demand and completion windows.\n\n- **Notice and termination windows in ongoing service agreements**  \n  - Property management: 60‑day written notice to terminate the agreement.[5]  \n  - Owner must notify agent within 5 business days of listing the property for sale.[5]  \n  - Holding tank contract: changes must be filed within 10 business days.[14]  \n  These are all short administrative windows governing when parties must act.\n\n- **Consumer protection / cancellation windows**  \n  - Lift purchase: 3 business days to cancel for a full refund.[2][6]  \n  - This is a distinct, very short window compared to the longer operational or warranty periods.\n\n- **Classification thresholds based on days**  \n  - Property management distinguishes short‑term vs long‑term rentals at 180 days.[7][8]  \n  This day‑based threshold affects fee structure and how rentals are treated.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the documents, the explicit day‑based timeframes (“time windows”) include:\n\n- **3 business days** – customer cancellation right for full refund in the lift purchase contract.[2][6]  \n- **5 business days** – owner’s deadline to notify property manager of a listing agreement if the property is for sale.[5]  \n- **10 business days** – owner’s deadline to file changes to the holding tank service contract with the municipality and county.[14]  \n- **60 days** –  \n  - Builder’s warranty period for specified items (doors, windows, switches, fixtures, caulking, plumbing fixtures, cabinet work).[1][12][13]  \n  - Deadline to make written claims within the 60‑day warranty period.[3][4]  \n  - Builder’s target period to complete repairs after receiving a written defect report (subject to delays).[1][3][4]  \n  - Maximum time after service of a complaint (or related pleading) to demand arbitration.[1][3][4]\n\n- **90 days** – labor warranty period in the lift purchase contract.[2][6]\n\n- **180 days** –  \n  - Threshold distinguishing short‑term rentals (“less than 180 days”) from long‑term leases (“more than 180 days”) in the property management agreement.[7][8]  \n  - Target maximum duration to conclude an arbitration after filing a dispute.[9][10][11]\n\n- **One (1) year / twelve months** –  \n  - Builder’s warranty period for major structural and system components.[1][12][13]  \n  - Overall warranty term end and claim deadline for those items.[3][4]  \n  - Initial term and automatic renewal periods for the property management agreement (initial 12 months, then successive one‑year terms).[5]\n\n- **Sixty (60) days written notice** – required notice period for either party to terminate the property management agreement.[5]\n\nThese are the explicit day‑based time windows that can be compared across the set of documents.",

The Agent shall be named as additional insured and shall be furnished with a copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance.” [2]\n\nThus, the insurance limits specified are:\n\n- Liability insurance minimum limit for bodily injury: **$300,000** [2]  \n- Liability insurance minimum limit for property damage to others: **$25,000** [2]  \n- Additional requirement: Agent must be named as an additional insured and provided with the policy and certificate of insurance [2].\n\nNo other document in the provided evidence specifies any insurance limits.\n\n**Answer to Q2/Q4 (per document):**\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**  \n  - Mentions insurance: Yes [2]  \n  - Insurance type: Liability Insurance coverage for the property [2]  \n  - Minimum limits:\n    - $300,000 for bodily injury [2]  \n    - $25,000 for property damage to others [2]  \n  - Additional insured: Agent must be named as additional insured; copy of policy and certificate must be furnished to Agent [2].\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- Sub-questions Q1 and Q3 both ask which documents mention “insurance.” The analysis shows that only the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** includes an explicit insurance clause and thus answers both Q1 and Q3 consistently [2].\n- Sub-questions Q2 and Q4 both ask, for those documents, what insurance limits are specified.

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1. How “coverage start” is defined\n\nThe warranty’s coverage start (commencement) is defined in Section 2.A of the Builder’s Limited Warranty. It states:\n\n> “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first.” [2][3]\n\nSo, coverage begins automatically on the earlier of these two events:\n\n1. **Date of final settlement** (i.e., closing/settlement of the purchase) [2][3], or  \n2. **Date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home** [2][3].\n\nThere are no additional actions required by the Buyer/Owner to “activate” the warranty; it starts by operation of the contract when one of those two triggering events occurs, with the earlier one controlling the start date (“whichever comes first”) [2][3].\n\n### Q2. What must happen before coverage ends (end-of-coverage triggers)\n\nThe warranty describes several triggers and conditions that determine when coverage ends.\n\n1. **Time-based termination of coverage**\n\nSection 2.B sets the basic time limits:\n\n> “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement.” [2][3]\n\nThis ties directly back to the commencement defined in 2.A. Once coverage has commenced (on the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy), each covered item has a fixed duration:\n\n- Certain structural and system components are warranted **for one (1) year** [10][13].\n- Certain items like doors, windows, switches, fixtures, and specified finish items are warranted **for sixty (60) days** [10][13].\n\nThus, for each category:\n\n- Coverage ends **1 year after the commencement date** for the one‑year items [2][3][10][13].\n- Coverage ends **60 days after the commencement date** for the 60‑day items [2][3][10][13].\n\n2. **Requirement that claims be made in writing before the period ends**\n\nSection 2.B also adds a claim-filing condition:\n\n> “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [2][3]\n\nAnd Section 6 reiterates:\n\n> The Buyer/Owner must, “prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable, write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested…” [2][3].\n\nSo, for coverage to apply:\n\n- The defect must fall within the applicable warranty period (1 year or 60 days from commencement) [2][3][10][13], and  \n- The Buyer/Owner must **submit a written claim by certified mail** describing the defect **before that period ends** [2][3][6].\n\nIf a claim is not made in writing within the applicable period, the warranty treats that claim as **not covered**, even if the defect was not discoverable during the period [2][3]. Functionally, this means coverage for that defect ends when the period expires without a timely written claim.\n\n3. **Automatic termination upon sale or move-out**\n\nSection 8 adds another end-of-coverage trigger:\n\n> “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [2][3]\n\nThus, coverage ends immediately if:\n\n- The first purchaser **sells the home**, or  \n- The first purchaser **moves out of the home**,  \n\neven if the 1‑year or 60‑day time period has not yet expired [2][3]. Because the warranty is non-transferable, no subsequent owner receives coverage [2][3].\n\n4. **Exclusion for late claims**\n\nSection 4.J reinforces the time/claim condition as an exclusion:\n\n> “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.” are excluded from coverage [2][3].\n\nThis confirms that once the applicable period ends without a proper written claim, coverage for those issues is considered terminated.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Start vs. End Relationship:**  \n  Coverage **starts** on the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy [2][3]. From that single commencement date, the warranty’s **end** is determined by:\n  - The fixed duration for each category (1 year or 60 days) counted from that start date [2][3][10][13], and  \n  - The requirement that any claim be made in writing before that duration expires [2][3][6].\n\n- **Event-based vs. Time-based End:**  \n  - Time-based: Coverage naturally expires after 1 year or 60 days from commencement, depending on the item [2][3][10][13].  \n  - Event-based: Coverage can end earlier if the first purchaser sells or moves out of the home, because the warranty is non-transferable and “automatically terminates” in that event [2][3][8].\n\n- **Claims Procedure as a Condition of Coverage:**  \n  The written-claim requirement is not just procedural; it is expressly tied to coverage. Failure to send a written claim by certified mail within the applicable period means the claim “is not covered” [2][3][6], effectively ending coverage for that defect at the end of the period.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder this Builder’s Limited Warranty, coverage **begins** on the earlier of (a) the date of final settlement or (b) the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home [2][3]. From that commencement date, different components are covered for either one year or sixty days [10][13], and coverage for each category **ends** when its respective period (1 year or 60 days) has elapsed, unless a written claim has been properly submitted before that deadline [2][3][6]. Additionally, the warranty automatically terminates in its entirety if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, because the warranty is non-transferable [2][3][8].",
            "text_norm": " analysis  q1. how coverage start is defined the warrantys coverage start commencement is defined in section 2.a of the builders limited warranty. it states:  the terms of the various coverages of this builders limited warranty begin on the date of final settlement or the date when the buyer/owner first occupies the home whichever comes first. 23 so coverage begins automatically on the earlier of these two events: 1. date of final settlement i.e. closing/settlement of the purchase 23 or 2. date when the buyer/owner first occupies the home 23. there are no additional actions required by the buyer/owner to activate the warranty it starts by operation of the contract when one of those two triggering events occurs with the earlier one controlling the start date whichever comes first 23.  q2. what must happen before coverage ends end-of-coverage triggers the warranty describes several triggers and conditions that determine when coverage ends. 1. time-based termination of coverage section 2.b sets the basic time limits:  except as otherwise provided herein the terms of this limited warranty terminate one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable after commencement. 23 this ties directly back to the commencement defined in 2.a. once coverage has commenced on the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy each covered item has a fixed duration: - certain structural and system components are warranted for one 1 year 1013. - certain items like doors windows switches fixtures and specified finish items are warranted for sixty 60 days 1013. thus for each category: - coverage ends 1 year after the commencement date for the oneyear items 231013. - coverage ends 60 days after the commencement date for the 60day items 231013. 2. requirement that claims be made in writing before the period ends section 2.b also adds a claim-filing condition:  any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered. 23 and section 6 reiterates:  the buyer/owner must prior to the termination of the one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable write a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested 23. so for coverage to apply: - the defect must fall within the applicable warranty period 1 year or 60 days from commencement 231013 and - the buyer/owner must submit a written claim by certified mail describing the defect before that period ends 236. if a claim is not made in writing within the applicable period the warranty treats that claim as not covered even if the defect was not discoverable during the period 23. functionally this means coverage for that defect ends when the period expires without a timely written claim. 3. automatic termination upon sale or move-out section 8 adds another end-of-coverage trigger:  this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates. 23 thus coverage ends immediately if: - the first purchaser sells the home or - the first purchaser moves out of the home even if the 1year or 60day time period has not yet expired 23. because the warranty is non-transferable no subsequent owner receives coverage 23. 4. exclusion for late claims section 4.j reinforces the time/claim condition as an exclusion:  any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable. are excluded from coverage 23. this confirms that once the applicable period ends without a proper written claim coverage for those issues is considered terminated.  key connections - start vs. end relationship: coverage starts on the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy 23. from that single commencement date the warrantys end is determined by: - the fixed duration for each category 1 year or 60 days counted from that start date 231013 and - the requirement that any claim be made in writing before that duration expires 236. - event-based vs. time-based end: - time-based: coverage naturally expires after 1 year or 60 days from commencement depending on the item 231013. - event-based: coverage can end earlier if the first purchaser sells or moves out of the home because the warranty is non-transferable and automatically terminates in that event 238. - claims procedure as a condition of coverage: the written-claim requirement is not just procedural it is expressly tied to coverage. failure to send a written claim by certified mail within the applicable period means the claim is not covered 236 effectively ending coverage for that defect at the end of the period.  conclusion under this builders limited warranty coverage begins on the earlier of a the date of final settlement or b the date the buyer/owner first occupies the home 23. from that commencement date different components are covered for either one year or sixty days 1013 and coverage for each category ends when its respective period 1 year or 60 days has elapsed unless a written claim has been properly submitted before that deadline 236. additionally the warranty automatically terminates in its entirety if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out because the warranty is non-transferable 238.",

How the “coverage start” is defined\n\nThe warranty defines a single “commencement” point for all of its coverages in Section 2 (“Term”):\n\n- “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on **the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first**.” [2][3]\n\nKey elements of the coverage start:\n\n- It is tied to **events**, not a fixed calendar date in the text:\n  - Event 1: “date of final settlement” (e.g., closing of the purchase) [2][3]\n  - Event 2: “date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home” [2][3]\n- The controlling rule is **“whichever comes first”**:\n  - If the buyer moves in before final settlement, coverage starts on the move‑in date.\n  - If final settlement occurs before move‑in, coverage starts on the settlement date. [2][3]\n- This “begin” date is the “commencement” referenced later when calculating the one‑year and sixty‑day periods. [2][3]\n\nThus, “coverage start” is specifically defined as the earlier of (a) final settlement or (b) first occupancy by the Buyer/Owner. [2][3]\n\n### Q2. What must happen before coverage ends\n\nThe warranty has two main time‑limited coverages (one year and sixty days) and additional conditions that can end or bar coverage.\n\n1. **Time limits from commencement**\n\nSection 1 sets the basic durations:\n\n- Structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical, and roof are warranted “for a period of **one (1) year**” [1][10][13].\n- Certain items (doors, windows, switches, receptacles, fixtures, caulking, cabinet work) are warranted “for a period of **sixty (60) days**” [1][10][13].\n\nSection 2 then ties these durations to the commencement date:\n\n- “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty **terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement**.” [2][3]\n\nSo, for each covered item:\n\n- Coverage ends automatically when its applicable period (1 year or 60 days) has elapsed from the coverage start (“commencement”). [2][3]\n\n2. **Written claim requirement before the period expires**\n\nThe warranty also imposes a condition on claims:\n\n- “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) [DAYS] AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [2][3]\n- Exclusions section reiterates: “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable” are excluded. [2][3]\n\nNotification procedure:\n\n- The Buyer/Owner “must, **prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable**, write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested” to the Builder’s address. [2][3][6]\n\nThus, for coverage to apply:\n\n- The defect must arise within the applicable warranty period, **and**\n- A written claim must be sent by certified mail **before** the relevant 1‑year or 60‑day period ends. [2][3][6]\n\nIf this does not occur, the claim “is not covered,” even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. [2][3]\n\n3. **Automatic termination upon sale or move‑out**\n\nThere is an additional, separate termination condition:\n\n- “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is **not transferable**. **In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.**” [2][3]\n\nSo coverage ends immediately if:\n\n- The first purchaser sells the home, or\n- The first purchaser moves out of the home,\n\neven if the 1‑year or 60‑day time period has not yet expired. [2][3]\n\n4. **Other exclusions that effectively bar coverage**\n\nWhile not “end dates,” several exclusions function as conditions that must not occur if coverage is to apply. For example, the warranty does not cover:\n\n- “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.” [2][3]\n- Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, acts of God, defects in owner‑installed items, etc. [2][3]\n\nIf a situation falls into these exclusions, coverage is effectively denied even if within the time period.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **coverage start** (earlier of final settlement or first occupancy) [2][3] is the anchor date (“commencement”) used to calculate when the **one‑year** and **sixty‑day** warranty periods end. [1][10][13][2][3]\n- The **end of coverage** is governed by:\n  - Passage of time from that commencement (1 year or 60 days, depending on the item) [1][10][13][2][3], and\n  - Compliance with the **written claim** requirement before that period expires [2][3][6], and\n  - The continued status of the first purchaser as owner‑occupant (no sale or move‑out) [2][3].\n- These rules work together: even if the time period has not fully run, coverage can end earlier if the home is sold or the first purchaser moves out; conversely, even within the time period, coverage is unavailable if the owner fails to submit a timely written claim or the issue falls under an exclusion. [2][3][6]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder this Builder’s Limited Warranty, coverage begins on the **earlier** of the date of final settlement or the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home (“commencement”). [2][3] From that start date, structural and major systems are covered for **one year**, and specified finish items are covered for **sixty days**. [1][10][13][2][3] Coverage ends when the applicable 1‑year or 60‑day period has elapsed from commencement, **unless it ends sooner** because the first purchaser sells the home or moves out (automatic termination) [2][3], or because the Buyer/Owner fails to submit a written claim by certified mail before the relevant period expires, in which case the claim “is not covered” regardless of when the defect was discovered.

            "text_norm": " analysis  q1. how the coverage start is defined the warranty defines a single commencement point for all of its coverages in section 2 term: - the terms of the various coverages of this builders limited warranty begin on the date of final settlement or the date when the buyer/owner first occupies the home whichever comes first. 23 key elements of the coverage start: - it is tied to events not a fixed calendar date in the text: - event 1: date of final settlement e.g. closing of the purchase 23 - event 2: date when the buyer/owner first occupies the home 23 - the controlling rule is whichever comes first: - if the buyer moves in before final settlement coverage starts on the movein date. - if final settlement occurs before movein coverage starts on the settlement date. 23 - this begin date is the commencement referenced later when calculating the oneyear and sixtyday periods. 23 thus coverage start is specifically defined as the earlier of a final settlement or b first occupancy by the buyer/owner. 23  q2. what must happen before coverage ends the warranty has two main timelimited coverages one year and sixty days and additional conditions that can end or bar coverage. 1. time limits from commencement section 1 sets the basic durations: - structural components plumbing heating electrical and roof are warranted for a period of one 1 year 11013. - certain items doors windows switches receptacles fixtures caulking cabinet work are warranted for a period of sixty 60 days 11013. section 2 then ties these durations to the commencement date: - except as otherwise provided herein the terms of this limited warranty terminate one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable after commencement. 23 so for each covered item: - coverage ends automatically when its applicable period 1 year or 60 days has elapsed from the coverage start commencement. 23 2. written claim requirement before the period expires the warranty also imposes a condition on claims: - any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 days as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered. 23 - exclusions section reiterates: any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable are excluded. 23 notification procedure: - the buyer/owner must prior to the termination of the one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable write a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the builders address. 236 thus for coverage to apply: - the defect must arise within the applicable warranty period and - a written claim must be sent by certified mail before the relevant 1year or 60day period ends. 236 if this does not occur the claim is not covered even if the defect was not discoverable earlier. 23 3. automatic termination upon sale or moveout there is an additional separate termination condition: - this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates. 23 so coverage ends immediately if: - the first purchaser sells the home or - the first purchaser moves out of the home even if the 1year or 60day time period has not yet expired. 23 4. other exclusions that effectively bar coverage while not end dates several exclusions function as conditions that must not occur if coverage is to apply. for example the warranty does not cover: - any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable. 23 - damage from ordinary wear and tear abuse neglect lack of maintenance acts of god defects in ownerinstalled items etc. 23 if a situation falls into these exclusions coverage is effectively denied even if within the time period.  key connections - the coverage start earlier of final settlement or first occupancy 23 is the anchor date commencement used to calculate when the oneyear and sixtyday warranty periods end. 1101323 - the end of coverage is governed by: - passage of time from that commencement 1 year or 60 days depending on the item 1101323 and - compliance with the written claim requirement before that period expires 236 and - the continued status of the first purchaser as owneroccupant no sale or moveout 23. - these rules work together: even if the time period has not fully run coverage can end earlier if the home is sold or the first purchaser moves out conversely even within the time period coverage is unavailable if the owner fails to submit a timely written claim or the issue falls under an exclusion. 236  conclusion under this builders limited warranty coverage begins on the earlier of the date of final settlement or the date the buyer/owner first occupies the home commencement. 23 from that start date structural and major systems are covered for one year and specified finish items are covered for sixty days. 1101323 coverage ends when the applicable 1year or 60day period has elapsed from commencement unless it ends sooner because the first purchaser sells the home or moves out automatic termination 23 or because the buyer/owner fails to submit a written claim by certified mail before the relevant period expires in which case the claim is not covered regardless of when the defect was discovered. 236",

Under Section 2 (“Term”), it states:\n\n> “The terms of the various coverages of this Builder's Limited Warranty begin on the date of final settlement or the date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home, whichever comes first.” [2][3]\n\nSo, coverage begins on the earlier of these two events:\n\n1. **The date of final settlement** (i.e., closing/settlement of the purchase), or  \n2. **The date when the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home**,\n\nand whichever of those two dates occurs first is the effective start date for all warranty periods (“after commencement”). [2][3]\n\nThere are different coverage durations (one year for major components and 60 days for certain items) described in Section 1, but all of those periods are measured from this same commencement date defined in Section 2(A). [10][13]\n\n### Q2. What must happen before coverage ends (end-of-coverage triggers)\n\nThe warranty describes several conditions and time limits that determine when coverage ends.\n\n1. **Expiration of the stated time periods (1 year or 60 days) from commencement**\n\nSection 2(B) provides:\n\n> “Except as otherwise provided herein, the terms of this Limited Warranty terminate one (1) year or sixty (60) days as applicable after commencement.” [2][3]\n\nThis means:\n\n- Items covered for **one year** (e.g., structural components, plumbing, heating, electrical, roof) are covered only until **one year after the coverage start date**. [10][13]\n- Items covered for **60 days** (e.g., doors, windows, switches, fixtures, certain caulking and cabinet work) are covered only until **60 days after the coverage start date**. [10][13]\n\nOnce those respective periods (1 year or 60 days) have elapsed from the commencement date, the warranty coverage for those items ends. [2][3]\n\n2. **Failure to submit written claims within the applicable period**\n\nSection 2(B) also states:\n\n> “ANY CLAIMS WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN MADE IN WRITING AS PROVIDED HEREIN, WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OR SIXTY (60) AS APPLICABLE, REGARDLESS OF DISCOVERABILITY, ARE NOT COVERED.” [2][3]\n\nAnd Section 4(J) reiterates:\n\n> “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.” [2][3]\n\nSection 6 explains the required action:\n\n> The Buyer/Owner “must, prior to the termination of the one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period as applicable, write a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder's office address…” [2][3]\n\nThus, for coverage to apply:\n\n- The **defect must be reported in writing** (by letter, sent certified mail, return receipt requested)  \n- **Before the applicable warranty period ends** (before the 1‑year or 60‑day period expires). [2][3]\n\nIf this written notice is not given within the applicable period, the claim is “not covered,” which effectively ends coverage for that defect once the period expires. [2][3]\n\n3. **Automatic termination if the first purchaser sells or moves out**\n\nSection 8 (“Not Transferable”) provides an additional termination trigger:\n\n> “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.” [2][3]\n\nSo, even if the 1‑year or 60‑day time period has not yet run, the warranty ends immediately when:\n\n- The first purchaser **sells the home**, or  \n- The first purchaser **moves out of the home**. [2][3]\n\nAfter either of those events, there is no remaining coverage for anyone.\n\n4. **Scope-based exclusions that function as practical limits**\n\nWhile not “end-of-coverage” in a temporal sense, Section 4 lists exclusions that define when coverage does not apply, including:\n\n- Claims not made in writing within the applicable period (as above). [2][3]\n- Defects covered by manufacturers’ warranties. [2][3]\n- Damage from wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, acts of God, etc. [2][3]\n\nThese exclusions mean that even during the warranty period, certain events or conditions will prevent coverage, but they do not change the formal start date; they limit what is covered before the end date.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Single commencement point:** All warranty periods (1‑year and 60‑day coverages) start from the same defined “coverage start” — the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [2][3]\n- **Time-based end plus action-based requirement:** Coverage ends when the applicable time period (1 year or 60 days) runs out, and any claim must be made in writing before that end; otherwise, it is not covered. [2][3]\n- **Event-based early termination:** Independently of the time limits, the warranty automatically terminates if the first purchaser sells or moves out of the home, cutting off coverage even if the original period has not expired. [2][3][8]\n- **Exclusions overlay:** Exclusions in Section 4 operate throughout the coverage period, limiting what is covered even before the formal end of the term. [2][3]\n\nTogether, these provisions define both the precise moment coverage begins and the combination of time limits, required actions, and events that bring coverage to an end.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder this Builder’s Limited Warranty, coverage begins on the earlier of (a) the date of final settlement or (b) the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home. [2][3] Coverage then continues only for the specified durations (one year or 60 days, depending on the item) measured from that start date, and it applies only to defects that are reported in writing by certified mail before the applicable period expires. [2][3] Coverage ends when the relevant 1‑year or 60‑day period runs out without timely written notice of a defect, and it also ends automatically if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, because the warranty is non‑transferable and terminates upon those events.

items covered for one year e.g. structural components plumbing heating electrical roof are covered only until one year after the coverage start date. 1013 - items covered for 60 days e.g. doors windows switches fixtures certain caulking and cabinet work are covered only until 60 days after the coverage start date. 1013 once those respective periods 1 year or 60 days have elapsed from the commencement date the warranty coverage for those items ends. 23 2. failure to submit written claims within the applicable period section 2b also states:  any claims which have not been made in writing as provided herein within one 1 year or sixty 60 as applicable regardless of discoverability are not covered. 23 and section 4j reiterates:  any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable. 23 section 6 explains the required action:  the buyer/owner must prior to the termination of the one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable write a letter describing the defect to the builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the builder at the builders office address 23 thus for coverage to apply: - the defect must be reported in writing by letter sent certified mail return receipt requested - before the applicable warranty period ends before the 1year or 60day period expires. 23 if this written notice is not given within the applicable period the claim is not covered which effectively ends coverage for that defect once the period expires. 23 3. automatic termination if the first purchaser sells or moves out section 8 not transferable provides an additional termination trigger:  this limited warranty is extended to the buyer/owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. in the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it this limited warranty automatically terminates. 23 so even if the 1year or 60day time period has not yet run the warranty ends immediately when: - the first purchaser sells the home or - the first purchaser moves out of the home. 23 after either of those events there is no remaining coverage for anyone. 4. scope-based exclusions that function as practical limits while not end-of-coverage in a temporal sense section 4 lists exclusions that define when coverage does not apply including: - claims not made in writing within the applicable period as above. 23 - defects covered by manufacturers warranties. 23 - damage from wear and tear abuse neglect lack of maintenance acts of god etc. 23 these exclusions mean that even during the warranty period certain events or conditions will prevent coverage but they do not change the formal start date they limit what is covered before the end date.  key connections -

[2][3]\n- Damage from wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, acts of God, etc. [2][3]\n\nThese exclusions mean that even during the warranty period, certain events or conditions will prevent coverage, but they do not change the formal start date; they limit what is covered before the end date.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Single commencement point:** All warranty periods (1‑year and 60‑day coverages) start from the same defined “coverage start” — the earlier of final settlement or first occupancy. [2][3]\n- **Time-based end plus action-based requirement:** Coverage ends when the applicable time period (1 year or 60 days) runs out, and any claim must be made in writing before that end; otherwise, it is not covered. [2][3]\n- **Event-based early termination:** Independently of the time limits, the warranty automatically terminates if the first purchaser sells or moves out of the home, cutting off coverage even if the original period has not expired. [2][3][8]\n- **Exclusions overlay:** Exclusions in Section 4 operate throughout the coverage period, limiting what is covered even before the formal end of the term. [2][3]\n\nTogether, these provisions define both the precise moment coverage begins and the combination of time limits, required actions, and events that bring coverage to an end.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nUnder this Builder’s Limited Warranty, coverage begins on the earlier of (a) the date of final settlement or (b) the date the Buyer/Owner first occupies the home. [2][3] Coverage then continues only for the specified durations (one year or 60 days, depending on the item) measured from that start date, and it applies only to defects that are reported in writing by certified mail before the applicable period expires. [2][3] Coverage ends when the relevant 1‑year or 60‑day period runs out without timely written notice of a defect, and it also ends automatically if the first purchaser sells the home or moves out, because the warranty is non‑transferable and terminates upon those events.

There is no indication of any adjustment that would change either total. Therefore, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total amount **do match exactly**.\n\n### Q4: If they match, what is the matching amount?\n\nSince they match exactly, the matching total amount is **$29,900.00** as stated in both the purchase contract [3][4] and the invoice [1].\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The scope of work in the purchase contract (vertical platform lift, power system, custom cab, outdoor package, aluminum door, hall call stations) [3][4] corresponds in nature to the items listed on the invoice (vertical platform lift, power system, special cab size, outdoor fitting, aluminum door, hall call stations) [1], supporting that the invoice is for the same project.\n- Both documents are issued by Contoso Lifts LLC and relate to lift equipment for a Fabrikam-related customer, reinforcing that the contract total and invoice total are for the same underlying transaction [1][3][4].\n- Both documents independently state the same overall monetary figure: $29,900.00 [1][3][4].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nYes, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total match exactly.

The line items in the scope of work describe what is being furnished and installed, but the only explicit monetary total for the contract is this $29,900.00 figure.\n\n**Answer to Q1 & Q6:** The total price specified in the purchase contract is **$29,900.00**, explicitly presented as the “Total contract price” in the Payment Terms section【3†L32-L39】【4†L32-L39】.\n\n---\n\n### Q2 & Q5: Total amount specified on the invoice and how it is presented\n\nThe invoice from Contoso Lifts LLC to John Doe / Fabrikam Construction lists multiple line items with quantities, unit prices, and totals, which sum to a **SUBTOTAL of $29,900.00**:\n\n- Vertical Platform Lift: 1 × 11,200.00 = 11,200.00  \n- 110 VAC/12 VAC operation parts: 1 × 3,000.00 = 3,000.00  \n- Special Size cab: 1 × 5,800.00 = 5,800.00  \n- Outdoor fitting: 1 × 2,000.00 = 2,000.00  \n- Aluminum door with operator: 1 × 5,000.00 = 5,000.00  \n- Hall Call stations: 2 × 1,450.00 = 2,900.00  \n\nThese line items produce:\n\n> “SUBTOTAL 29900.00  \n> TAX N/A  \n> TOTAL 29900.00  \n> AMOUNT DUE 29900.00”【1†L39-L47】.\n\nThere are no taxes, fees, or discounts applied (tax is explicitly “N/A”), so the invoice total and amount due are **$29,900.00**【1†L39-L47】.\n\n**Answer to Q2 & Q5:** The total amount on the invoice is **$29,900.00**, explicitly presented in the invoice as “TOTAL 29900.00” and “AMOUNT DUE 29900.00” after a subtotal of 29,900.00 and tax “N/A”【1†L39-L47】.\n\n---\n\n### Q3 & Q7: Do the purchase contract total and invoice total match exactly?\n\n- Purchase contract total price: **$29,900.00**【3†L32-L39】【4†L32-L39】.  \n- Invoice total / amount due: **$29,900.00**【1†L39-L47】.\n\nBoth documents state the same total amount, with no additional adjustments, taxes, or discounts that would change either total. Therefore, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total amount **match exactly** at $29,900.00.\n\n**Answer to Q3 & Q7:** Yes, the purchase contract total price and the invoice total amount match exactly; both are **$29,900.00**【1†L39-L47】【3†L32-L39】.\n\n---\n\n### Q4 & Q8: If they match, what is the exact matching amount?\n\nGiven the exact equality identified above:\n\n- Contract: “Total contract price is $29,900.00”【3†L32-L39】.  \n- Invoice: “TOTAL 29900.00” and “AMOUNT DUE 29900.00”【1†L39-L47】.\n\n**Answer to Q4 & Q8:** The exact matching amount is **$29,900.00**【1†L39-L47】【3†L32-L39】.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **scope of work** in the purchase contract (vertical platform lift, power system, custom cab, outdoor package, aluminum door, hall call stations) aligns conceptually with the **line items** on the invoice (vertical platform lift, operation parts, special size cab, outdoor fitting, aluminum door with operator, hall call stations)【3†L16-L27】【1†L24-L38】, indicating they refer to the same project.\n- The **contract’s total price** is a single figure of **$29,900.00** with installment breakdowns but no further monetary adjustments【3†L32-L39】.\n- The **invoice** aggregates its line items to a **SUBTOTAL of $29,900.00**, applies **no tax (N/A)**, and presents a **TOTAL and AMOUNT DUE of $29,900.00**【1†L39-L47】.\n- Because both documents independently arrive at **$29,900.00** as their overall total, and no other charges or discounts are specified, the totals are directly comparable and identical【1†L39-L47】【3†L32-L39】.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe purchase contract total price and the invoice total **do match**.

(Builder) and Contoso Ltd. (Buyer/Owner).[1]  \n  - Exhibit A – Scope of Work: both in the signature block.[5]  \n  - Holding Tank Servicing Contract: Contoso Ltd. (Owner) and Fabrikam Inc.

No percentages are specified.  \n   - **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: mentions “cost and fees of the arbitration” but only in the sense that “Each party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration”[1]. This is a cost‑sharing ratio, not a fee schedule or commercial fee structure, and no percentage of price/revenue is defined as a fee.  \n   - **PURCHASE CONTRACT**: uses “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments”[4][5]; this is a price and payment schedule, not described as “fees,” and no percentage‑based fee is specified.  \n   - **contoso_lifts_invoice**: lists unit prices and totals, but not “fees” as such[9].  \n   - **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** and **warranty** documents do not define percentage‑based “fees.”\n\n**Answer to Q1:**  \nOnly the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** explicitly describes “fees” that use a percentage‑based fee structure (25%, 10%, 10%, and 4.712%)[13][14][17]. Other documents either do not define fees at all or do not express them as percentages of a base amount.\n\n---\n\n### Q2: For each relevant doc, what “fees” concepts are described, and are any explicitly fixed installment payments?\n\nWe look for “fees” that are paid as fixed installments (e.g., fixed amounts at defined milestones).\n\n1. **PURCHASE CONTRACT** – fixed installment payments (but framed as contract price, not “fees”)  \n   The payment terms state:  \n   - “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:  \n     · $20,000.00 upon signing  \n     · $7,000.00 upon delivery  \n     · $2,900.00 upon completion”[4][5]  \n\n   These are clearly fixed installment payments tied to milestones. The document calls this “Total contract price” and “Payment Terms,” not “fees”[4][5]. However, in the context of the original query (comparing “fees” concepts vs. installment structures), this is the clearest example of a fixed installment payment structure.\n\n2. **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** – fixed recurring/flat fees, but not installment schedule  \n   The agreement includes fixed dollar amounts:  \n   - Advertising: “$75.00/month”[13]  \n   - Administration/accounting: “$50.00/month”[13]  \n   - Hourly charge: “$35/hour”[13]  \n   - Start‑up fee: “$250.00” one‑time[13]  \n\n   These are fixed amounts, but they are not described as “installments” of a larger lump sum; they are ongoing monthly charges or a one‑time fee. So they are fixed fees, but not “fixed installment payments” in the sense of a multi‑installment payment plan for a single total.\n\n3. **Other docs**  \n   - **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: payment is “charges incurred … as mutually agreed upon”[12]; no installment structure.  \n   - **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: no installment payment structure; only cost‑sharing of arbitration fees (“one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration”)[1].  \n   - **contoso_lifts_invoice**: shows a single “AMOUNT DUE 29900.00”[9], not installments.  \n\n**Answer to Q2:**  \nThe **PURCHASE CONTRACT** explicitly specifies fixed installment payments (three fixed dollar amounts at defined milestones)[4][5]. The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** has fixed dollar fees, but they are recurring or one‑time charges, not structured as installments of a total contract price[13].\n\n---\n\n### Q3: Which specific docs use a percentage‑based fee structure, and which use fixed installment payments?\n\n- **Percentage‑based fee structure:**  \n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:  \n    - 25% of gross revenues for short‑term/vacation rentals[13]  \n    - 10% of gross revenues for long‑term leases[13]  \n    - 10% of total charges for repairs/upgrades/renovations[13]  \n    - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all fees/commissions/charges[13]  \n\n- **Fixed installment payments:**  \n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n    - Total price $29,900.00, “payable in 3 installments” of $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion[4][5].  \n\nNo other document in the provided corpus both (a) clearly defines “fees” and (b) structures them as fixed installments.\n\n---\n\n### Q4: For each relevant document, list the specific “fees” and whether each is explicitly percentage‑based\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (short‑term/vacation rentals)[13][14][17]:\n\n- Fee/commission for short‑term/vacation rentals:  \n  - “twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues” – explicitly percentage‑based[13].\n- Fee/commission for long‑term leases:  \n  - “ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues” – explicitly percentage‑based[13].\n- Fee on repairs/upgrades/renovations:  \n  - “ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations” – explicitly percentage‑based[13].\n- Hawaii Gross Excise tax:  \n  - “4.712% on all the above fees, commissions and charges” – explicitly percentage‑based[13].\n- Advertising charge:  \n  - “$75.00/month” – fixed dollar amount, not percentage‑based[13].\n- Administration/accounting minimum:  \n  - “$50.00/month” – fixed dollar amount, not percentage‑based[13].\n- Scheduling/escort charge:  \n  - “$35/hour” – fixed hourly rate, not percentage‑based[13].\n- Agency start‑up fee:  \n  - “$250.00 … non‑refundable start‑up fee” – fixed dollar amount, not percentage‑based[13].\n\n**Other documents:**\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: refers generically to “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon”[12]; no explicit percentages.  \n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: “one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration”[1] is a 50/50 cost split, but not a commercial “fee” structure like a commission; it is a sharing rule for arbitration costs.  \n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**: does not label any amounts as “fees”; it defines a contract price and installments[4][5].  \n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: lists prices and totals, not “fees” as a separate concept[9].\n\n---\n\n### Q5: For each relevant document, list the specific “fees” and whether each is explicitly paid as fixed installment payments\n\n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n  - Concept: total contract price, not called a “fee,” but clearly paid as fixed installments:  \n    - “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments: $20,000.00 upon signing; $7,000.00 upon delivery; $2,900.00 upon completion”[4][5].  \n  - These are explicitly fixed installment payments.\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:  \n  - Fees are either percentage‑based (commissions, tax) or fixed recurring/one‑time charges (monthly advertising, monthly admin, hourly scheduling, one‑time start‑up)[13].  \n  - None are described as being paid in a series of fixed installments toward a single lump‑sum obligation; instead, they accrue as services are rendered or per month.

However, in the context of the original query (comparing “fees” concepts vs. installment structures), this is the clearest example of a fixed installment payment structure.\n\n2. **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** – fixed recurring/flat fees, but not installment schedule  \n   The agreement includes fixed dollar amounts:  \n   - Advertising: “$75.00/month”[13]  \n   - Administration/accounting: “$50.00/month”[13]  \n   - Hourly charge: “$35/hour”[13]  \n   - Start‑up fee: “$250.00” one‑time[13]  \n\n   These are fixed amounts, but they are not described as “installments” of a larger lump sum; they are ongoing monthly charges or a one‑time fee. So they are fixed fees, but not “fixed installment payments” in the sense of a multi‑installment payment plan for a single total.\n\n3. **Other docs**  \n   - **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: payment is “charges incurred … as mutually agreed upon”[12]; no installment structure.  \n   - **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: no installment payment structure; only cost‑sharing of arbitration fees (“one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration”)[1].  \n   - **contoso_lifts_invoice**: shows a single “AMOUNT DUE 29900.00”[9], not installments.  \n\n**Answer to Q2:**  \nThe **PURCHASE CONTRACT** explicitly specifies fixed installment payments (three fixed dollar amounts at defined milestones)[4][5]. The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** has fixed dollar fees, but they are recurring or one‑time charges, not structured as installments of a total contract price[13].\n\n---\n\n### Q3: Which specific docs use a percentage‑based fee structure, and which use fixed installment payments?\n\n- **Percentage‑based fee structure:**  \n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:  \n    - 25% of gross revenues for short‑term/vacation rentals[13]  \n    - 10% of gross revenues for long‑term leases[13]  \n    - 10% of total charges for repairs/upgrades/renovations[13]  \n    - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all fees/commissions/charges[13]  \n\n- **Fixed installment payments:**  \n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n    - Total price $29,900.00, “payable in 3 installments” of $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion[4][5].  \n\nNo other document in the provided corpus both (a) clearly defines “fees” and (b) structures them as fixed installments.\n\n---\n\n### Q4: For each relevant document, list the specific “fees” and whether each is explicitly percentage‑based\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (short‑term/vacation rentals)[13][14][17]:\n\n- Fee/commission for short‑term/vacation rentals:  \n  - “twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues” – explicitly percentage‑based[13].\n- Fee/commission for long‑term leases:  \n  - “ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues” – explicitly percentage‑based[13].\n- Fee on repairs/upgrades/renovations:  \n  - “ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations” – explicitly percentage‑based[13].\n- Hawaii Gross Excise tax:  \n  - “4.712% on all the above fees, commissions and charges” – explicitly percentage‑based[13].\n- Advertising charge:  \n  - “$75.00/month” – fixed dollar amount, not percentage‑based[13].\n- Administration/accounting minimum:  \n  - “$50.00/month” – fixed dollar amount, not percentage‑based[13].\n- Scheduling/escort charge:  \n  - “$35/hour” – fixed hourly rate, not percentage‑based[13].\n- Agency start‑up fee:  \n  - “$250.00 … non‑refundable start‑up fee” – fixed dollar amount, not percentage‑based[13].\n\n**Other documents:**\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: refers generically to “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon”[12]; no explicit percentages.  \n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: “one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration”[1] is a 50/50 cost split, but not a commercial “fee” structure like a commission; it is a sharing rule for arbitration costs.  \n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**: does not label any amounts as “fees”; it defines a contract price and installments[4][5].  \n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: lists prices and totals, not “fees” as a separate concept[9].\n\n---\n\n### Q5: For each relevant document, list the specific “fees” and whether each is explicitly paid as fixed installment payments\n\n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n  - Concept: total contract price, not called a “fee,” but clearly paid as fixed installments:  \n    - “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments: $20,000.00 upon signing; $7,000.00 upon delivery; $2,900.00 upon completion”[4][5].  \n  - These are explicitly fixed installment payments.\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:  \n  - Fees are either percentage‑based (commissions, tax) or fixed recurring/one‑time charges (monthly advertising, monthly admin, hourly scheduling, one‑time start‑up)[13].  \n  - None are described as being paid in a series of fixed installments toward a single lump‑sum obligation; instead, they accrue as services are rendered or per month. So they are fixed amounts but not “installment payments” in the sense used in the purchase contract.\n\n- **Other docs**:  \n  - **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: no installment structure; payment is “charges … as mutually agreed upon”[12].  \n  - **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: no installment fee structure[1].  \n  - **contoso_lifts_invoice**: single amount due[9].\n\n---\n\n### Q6: Which documents explicitly specify percentage‑based “fees,” and which explicitly specify “fees” (or payments) as fixed installments?\n\n- **Explicit percentage‑based “fees”:**  \n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**:  \n    - 25% of gross revenues (short‑term rentals)[13]  \n    - 10% of gross revenues (long‑term leases)[13]  \n    - 10% of total repair/upgrade/renovation charges[13]  \n    - 4.712% tax on all fees/commissions/charges[13]  \n\n- **Explicit fixed installment payments (for the main monetary obligation):**  \n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n    - Total price $29,900.00 “payable in 3 installments” of fixed dollar amounts at defined milestones[4][5].  \n\nNo other document both uses the term “fees” and structures them as fixed installments.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the only document that clearly defines a **percentage‑based fee structure**, with multiple fees expressed as a percentage of gross revenues or total charges, plus a percentage tax on those fees[13][14][17].\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that clearly uses a **fixed installment payment structure**, specifying a total price broken into three fixed milestone payments[4][5].\n- Other documents (warranty, holding tank contract, invoice) either do not define “fees” in a commercial sense or do not specify them as percentages or installments.\n\nThus, when comparing “fees” concepts across the corpus:\n\n- “Fees as percentages of revenue/charges” → **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**[13].  \n- “Payments as fixed installments of a total contract amount” → **PURCHASE CONTRACT**[4][5].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe document that has a percentage‑based fee structure is the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**, which sets agent commissions and certain charges as percentages of gross revenues or total charges and applies a percentage tax to those fees[13][14][17].  \n\nThe document that uses fixed installment payments is the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**, which specifies that the total contract price of $29,900.00 is payable in three fixed installments of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 at defined milestones[4][5].",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1 – Documents with a percentage‑based fee structure and how it is described\n\nThe **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** contains multiple percentage‑based fees:\n\n- “A fee/commission of **twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues** for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days).” [13], [14], [17]  \n- “A fee/commission of **ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues** for management services for long term leases (leases of more than 180 days).” [13], [14], [17]  \n- “A fee of **ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations**.” [13], [14], [17]  \n- Additionally, “the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the **Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges**.” [13], [14], [17]\n\nThese provisions explicitly state that certain fees are calculated as a percentage of:\n- “gross revenues” (for rental management commissions) [13], [14], [17], and  \n- the “total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations” (for the repair‑related fee) [13], [14], [17],  \nwith an additional percentage tax applied to all those fees [13], [14], [17].\n\nThus, the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the document with a clearly percentage‑based fee structure.\n\n### Q2 – Documents with fixed installment payment structures and how they are described\n\nThe **PURCHASE CONTRACT** sets out a fixed, installment‑style payment schedule:\n\n- “Total contract price is **$29,900.00, payable in 3 installments**:” [4], [5]  \n  - “**$20,000.00 upon signing**” [4], [5]  \n  - “**$7,000.00 upon delivery**” [4], [5]  \n  - “**$2,900.00 upon completion**” [4], [5]\n\nThese are fixed dollar amounts, tied to specific milestones (signing, delivery, completion), and explicitly described as “payable in 3 installments” [4], [5]. There is no percentage calculation; the amounts are predetermined.\n\nNo other document in the provided context sets out a similar fixed installment fee/payment schedule as clearly as the PURCHASE CONTRACT.\n\n### Q3 – How percentage‑based vs fixed‑installment structures differ in calculation and payment\n\n**Basis of calculation**\n\n- **Percentage‑based (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT):**  \n  - Fees are calculated as a percentage of variable bases:\n    - “gross revenues” from rentals (25% for short‑term, 10% for long‑term) [13], [14], [17], and  \n    - “total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations” (10%) [13], [14], [17].  \n  - The Hawaii Gross Excise tax is also a percentage (4.712%) applied to “all the above fees, commissions and charges” [13], [14], [17].  \n  - Because the bases (gross revenues, repair costs) can change over time, the actual dollar amount of the fees varies accordingly.\n\n- **Fixed installments (PURCHASE CONTRACT):**  \n  - The total price is a fixed sum ($29,900.00) [4], [5].  \n  - Each installment is a fixed dollar amount ($20,000; $7,000; $2,900) [4], [5].  \n  - The amounts do not depend on revenues, costs, or other variable metrics; they are predetermined and sum to the total contract price.\n\n**How they are paid (timing, frequency, amount characteristics)**\n\n- **Percentage‑based (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT):**\n  - Timing/frequency is tied to ongoing management activity and billing cycles, not explicitly stated as “installments,” but implied to be recurring as rentals occur and repairs are performed. The agent “collect[s] all rents” and provides “a monthly statement of income and expenses” [17], so the percentage‑based commissions and fees are naturally aligned with those revenue and expense flows.\n  - Amounts are **variable**: if gross revenues or repair costs increase or decrease, the fee amounts change proportionally [13], [14], [17].\n\n- **Fixed installments (PURCHASE CONTRACT):**\n  - Timing is tied to **specific milestones**:\n    - upon signing,  \n    - upon delivery,  \n    - upon completion [4], [5].  \n  - There are exactly three payments (“payable in 3 installments” [4], [5]), not an open‑ended recurring structure.\n  - Amounts are **fixed** and known in advance; they do not vary with usage, revenue, or cost changes.\n\n### Q4 – Where the percentage‑based structure is explicitly stated and detailed\n\nThe percentage‑based fee structure is explicitly stated in the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (including its repeated versions):\n\n- **Document(s):** PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT [13], [14], [17].  \n- **Description and bases:**\n  - 25% of **gross revenues** for short‑term/vacation rentals (reservations < 180 days) [13], [14], [17].  \n  - 10% of **gross revenues** for long‑term leases (leases > 180 days) [13], [14], [17].  \n  - 10% of the **total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations** [13], [14], [17].  \n  - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax applied to “all the above fees, commissions and charges” [13], [14], [17].  \n\nThe conditions/qualifiers include:\n- The distinction between short‑term (<180 days) and long‑term (>180 days) rentals, which determines whether the 25% or 10% commission applies [13], [14], [17].  \n- The tax rate is “currently at 4.712%,” indicating it may be subject to change by law, but is applied to all the agent’s fees and commissions under the agreement [13], [14], [17].\n\n### Q5 – Where fixed installment payments are explicitly stated and detailed\n\nThe fixed installment payment structure is explicitly stated in the **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:\n\n- **Document(s):** PURCHASE CONTRACT [4], [5].  \n- **Description:**\n  - “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:” [4], [5]  \n    - “$20,000.00 upon signing” [4], [5]  \n    - “$7,000.00 upon delivery” [4], [5]  \n    - “$2,900.00 upon completion” [4], [5]\n\n**Amount:** Fixed dollar amounts totaling $29,900.00 [4], [5].  \n**Frequency/number of payments:** Three installments [4], [5].  \n**Duration/conditions:** Payments are due at specific project milestones (signing, delivery, completion) rather than on a calendar schedule [4], [5]. The contract is “effective upon mutual signature and initial payment” [4], [5], linking contract effectiveness to the first installment.\n\n### Q6 – Detailed comparison of calculation and payment characteristics\n\n**Calculation basis and variability**\n\n- **Percentage‑based (PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT):**\n  - Calculated as a **percentage of variable economic measures**:\n    - gross rental revenues [13], [14], [17],  \n    - total repair/upgrade/renovation charges [13], [14], [17],  \n    - plus a percentage tax on those fees [13], [14], [17].  \n  - The fee amounts **fluctuate** with:\n    - occupancy and rental rates (affecting gross revenues), and  \n    - the volume and cost of repairs/upgrades.  \n\n- **Fixed installments (PURCHASE CONTRACT):**\n  - Calculated as **fixed, pre‑agreed dollar amounts** that sum to the total contract price [4], [5].  \n  - There is no dependency on revenues, usage, or cost overruns; the fee (price) is **non‑variable** unless changed by a separate written change order (changes “will affect the next payment milestone” [4]).\n\n**Payment timing, frequency, and amount characteristics**\n\n- **Percentage‑based:**\n  - Payments are **ongoing and recurring**, aligned with:\n    - rental income cycles (commissions on gross revenues) [13], [14], [17], and  \n    - occurrence of repairs/upgrades (10% of total charges) [13], [14], [17].  \n  - The agreement contemplates monthly accounting (“monthly statement of income and expenses” [17]), so fees are likely settled periodically rather than in a finite number of installments.\n  - Amounts per period are **uncertain and variable**, depending on actual performance and activity.\n\n- **Fixed installments:**\n  - Payments occur **only three times**, at clearly defined project milestones [4], [5].  \n  - The amounts are **known and fixed** in advance ($20,000; $7,000; $2,900) [4], [5].  \n  - There is no ongoing percentage‑of‑revenue or usage‑based component; once the three installments are paid, the payment obligation for the contract price is complete (subject to any change orders) [4].\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** exemplifies a **percentage‑based fee model**, where the agent’s compensation scales with the economic performance of the property (gross revenues) and the magnitude of repair/upgrade spending, and is further subject to a percentage tax [13], [14], [17].\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** exemplifies a **fixed installment payment model**, where the customer pays a fixed total price in a small number of predetermined installments tied to project milestones, independent of revenues or variable costs [4], [5].\n- The core contrast:\n  - **Variable, performance‑linked, recurring fees** (percentage‑based) vs.  \n  - **Fixed, milestone‑linked, finite payments** (installments).\n\nThese differences directly answer how the “fees” concepts differ between the documents in both calculation method and payment structure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the document with a **percentage‑based fee structure**, with fees stated as percentages of gross rental revenues and total repair/upgrade charges, plus a percentage tax on those fees [13], [14], [17].\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document with **fixed installment payments**, specifying a total contract price of $29,900.00 payable in three fixed installments of $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, and $2,900 upon completion [4], [5].\n- The percentage‑based structure yields variable, recurring fees tied to revenues and costs, whereas the fixed installment structure uses predetermined, milestone‑based amounts that do not vary with performance.",

a fee/commission of ten percent 10% of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases leases of more than 180 days. 13 14 17 - a fee of ten percent 10% on the total charge for repairs upgrades and/or renovations. 13 14 17 - additionally the agent will assess/charge the owner the hawaii gross excise tax currently at 4.712% on all the above fees commissions and charges. 13 14 17 these provisions explicitly state that certain fees are calculated as a percentage of: -

total contract price is $29900.00 payable in 3 installments: 4 5 - $20000.00 upon signing 4 5 - $7000.00 upon delivery 4 5 - $2900.00 upon completion 4 5 these are fixed dollar amounts tied to specific milestones signing delivery completion and explicitly described as payable in 3 installments 4 5. there is no percentage calculation the amounts are predetermined. no other document in the provided context sets out a similar fixed installment fee/payment schedule as clearly as the purchase contract.  q3  how percentagebased vs fixedinstallment structures differ in calculation and payment basis of calculation - percentagebased property management agreement: - fees are calculated as a percentage of variable bases: - gross revenues from rentals 25% for shortterm 10% for longterm 13 14 17 and - total charge for repairs upgrades and/or renovations 10% 13 14 17. - the hawaii gross excise tax is also a percentage 4.712% applied to all the above fees commissions and charges 13 14 17. - because the bases gross revenues repair costs can change over time the actual dollar amount of the fees varies accordingly. - fixed installments purchase contract: - the total price is a fixed sum $29900.00 4 5. - each installment is a fixed dollar amount $20000 $7000 $2900 4 5. - the amounts do not depend on revenues costs or other variable metrics they are predetermined and sum to the total contract price. how they are paid timing frequency amount characteristics -

upon signing - upon delivery - upon completion 4 5. - there are exactly three payments payable in 3 installments 4 5 not an openended recurring structure. - amounts are fixed and known in advance they do not vary with usage revenue or cost changes.  q4  where the percentagebased structure is explicitly stated and detailed the percentagebased fee structure is explicitly stated in the property management agreement including its repeated versions: - documents: property management agreement 13 14 17. - description and bases: - 25% of gross revenues for shortterm/vacation rentals reservations  180 days 13 14 17. - 10% of gross revenues for longterm leases leases  180 days 13 14 17. - 10% of the total charge for repairs upgrades and/or renovations 13 14 17. - 4.712% hawaii gross excise tax applied to all the above fees commissions and charges 13 14 17. the conditions/qualifiers include: - the distinction between shortterm 180 days and longterm 180 days rentals which determines whether the 25% or 10% commission applies 13 14 17. - the tax rate is currently at 4.712% indicating it may be subject to change by law but is applied to all the agents fees and commissions under the agreement 13 14 17.  q5  where fixed installment payments are explicitly stated and detailed the fixed installment payment structure is explicitly stated in the purchase contract: - documents: purchase contract 4 5. - description: - total contract price is $29900.00 payable in 3 installments: 4 5 - $20000.00 upon signing 4 5 - $7000.00 upon delivery 4 5 - $2900.00 upon completion 4 5 amount: fixed dollar amounts totaling $29900.00 4 5. frequency/number of payments: three installments 4 5. duration/conditions: payments are due at specific project milestones signing delivery completion rather than on a calendar schedule 4 5. the contract is effective upon mutual signature and initial payment 4 5 linking contract effectiveness to the first installment.  q6  detailed comparison of calculation and payment characteristics calculation basis and variability - percentagebased property management agreement: - calculated as a percentage of variable economic measures: - gross rental revenues 13 14 17 - total repair/upgrade/renovation charges 13 14 17 - plus a percentage tax on those fees 13 14 17. - the fee amounts fluctuate with: - occupancy and rental rates affecting gross revenues and - the volume and cost of repairs/upgrades. - fixed installments purchase contract: - calculated as fixed preagreed dollar amounts that sum to the total contract price 4 5. - there is no dependency on revenues usage or cost overruns the fee price is nonvariable unless changed by a separate written change order changes will affect the next payment milestone 4. payment timing frequency and amount characteristics - percentagebased: - payments are ongoing and recurring aligned with: - rental income cycles commissions on gross revenues 13 14 17 and - occurrence of repairs/upgrades 10% of total charges 13 14 17. - the agreement contemplates monthly accounting monthly statement of income and expenses 17 so fees are likely settled periodically rather than in a finite number of installments. - amounts per period are uncertain and variable depending on actual performance and activity. - fixed installments: - payments occur only three times at clearly defined project milestones 4 5. - the amounts are known and fixed in advance $20000 $7000 $2900 4 5. - there is no ongoing percentageofrevenue or usagebased component once the three installments are paid the payment obligation for the contract price is complete subject to any change orders 4.  key connections - the property management agreement exemplifies a percentagebased fee model where the agents compensation scales with the economic performance of the property gross revenues and the magnitude of repair/upgrade spending and is further subject to a percentage tax 13 14 17. - the purchase contract exemplifies a fixed installment payment model where the customer pays a fixed total price in a small number of predetermined installments tied to project milestones independent of revenues or variable costs 4 5. - the core contrast: - variable performancelinked recurring fees percentagebased vs. - fixed milestonelinked finite payments installments. these differences directly answer how the fees concepts differ between the documents in both calculation method and payment structure.  conclusion - the property management agreement is the document with a percentagebased fee structure with fees stated as percentages of gross rental revenues and total repair/upgrade charges plus a percentage tax on those fees 13 14 17. - the purchase contract is the document with fixed installment payments specifying a total contract price of $29900.00 payable in three fixed installments of $20000 upon signing $7000 upon delivery and $2900 upon completion 4 5. -

These are fixed amounts, not percentages. No percentage-based fee structure is described.\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: Refers generally to “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon” [12], but does not specify any percentage-based fee.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY / coverage**: Discusses arbitration costs (“Each party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration” [1][2][3])—this is a cost-sharing fraction, not a fee structure tied to a base amount like revenue, and no percentage-based “fee” schedule is laid out.\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Lists unit prices and totals for items, with a subtotal and “TAX N/A” [9]; no percentage-based fee is specified.\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** and **purchase_contract** do not define any percentage-of-revenue or similar fee structure.\n\nThus, the only document that clearly uses percentage-based fee structures for “fees” is the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** [13][14][17].\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Fixed installment payment “fees” concepts in each relevant document\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT**\n\nThe payment terms are explicitly structured as fixed installments:\n\n- “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:  \n  · $20,000.00 upon signing  \n  · $7,000.00 upon delivery  \n  · $2,900.00 upon completion” [4][5].\n\nThese are fixed dollar amounts tied to milestones, i.e., a fixed installment payment structure.\n\n**Other documents**\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**: Contains fixed monthly and hourly charges (e.g., “$75.00/month” for advertising, “$50.00/month” for administration, “$35/hour” for certain services, and a one-time “two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)” start-up fee [13][14][17]). These are fixed fees, but they are not described as a finite series of installments toward a total contract price; they are ongoing or one-time charges, not an installment payment plan.\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Shows a one-time “AMOUNT DUE 29900.00” [9], not broken into installments.\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: Refers to paying “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s)” [12], but does not specify installments.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY / coverage**: No installment payment structure is described; only cost-sharing for arbitration (each party pays half of arbitration costs) [1][2][3].\n\nTherefore, the **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that explicitly uses fixed installment payments.\n\n---\n\n### Q3: Comparison – which doc uses percentage-based fees vs fixed installment payments?\n\n- **Percentage-based fee structure**:  \n  The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** uses percentage-based fees for:\n  - 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rental management [13][14][17].  \n  - 10% of gross revenues for long-term lease management [13][14][17].  \n  - 10% of the total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations [13][14][17].  \n  - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all those fees and charges [13][14][17].\n\n- **Fixed installment payments**:  \n  The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** uses fixed installment payments:\n  - Total price $29,900.00, payable in three fixed installments of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 at specified milestones [4][5].\n\nNo other document combines “fees” with an explicit percentage-of-base structure or a defined installment schedule in the same way.\n\n---\n\n### Q4: For each “fees” concept, does the document specify percentage-based structure?\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT – fee concepts and whether percentage-based**\n\n- Credit card/bankcard fees deducted from Owner’s proceeds [13][14][17]:  \n  Mentioned, but no percentage rate is specified in the text.\n- 25% commission on gross revenues for short-term/vacation rentals – explicitly percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- 10% commission on gross revenues for long-term leases – explicitly percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- 10% fee on total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations – explicitly percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- Advertising charge: $75.00/month – fixed amount, not percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- Administration/accounting: $50.00/month – fixed amount, not percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- $35/hour charge for scheduling/escorting contractors – fixed hourly rate, not percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- Hawaii Gross Excise tax at 4.712% on all the above fees/commissions/charges – explicitly percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- Agency start-up fee: $250.00 – fixed amount, not percentage-based [13][14][17].\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT – fee concepts**\n\n- Total contract price and its installments are fixed dollar amounts [4][5]; no percentage-based fee is specified.\n\n**Other docs**\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon” [12] – no percentage structure specified.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY / coverage**: “Each party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration” [1][2][3] – this is a 50/50 cost split, but not a fee schedule tied to a revenue or contract base; it is a cost allocation rule, not a recurring fee concept like commissions.\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Lists prices and totals [9]; no percentage-based fee structure.\n\n---\n\n### Q5: For each “fees” concept, does the document specify fixed installment payments?\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT**\n\n- The only explicit installment structure is the payment of the total contract price in three fixed installments: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion [4][5].  \n  These are clearly fixed installment payments.\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\n- Fees like $75/month, $50/month, and $35/hour are fixed recurring or hourly charges [13][14][17], but they are not described as a finite series of installments toward a defined total; they are ongoing service fees. The $250 start-up fee is a one-time fixed payment [13][14][17]. None of these are framed as “installments” of a larger fixed price.\n\n**Other docs**\n\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: One-time amount due [9], no installments.\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: Payment of “charges incurred” [12], no installment schedule.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY / coverage**: No installment payment structure.\n\nThus, only the **PURCHASE CONTRACT** explicitly uses fixed installment payments.\n\n---\n\n### Q6: Which specific documents use percentage-based fee structures vs fixed installment payments?\n\n- **Documents with percentage-based fee structures**:\n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (including its full version [17] and the fee excerpt [13][14]):  \n    - 25% of gross revenues (short-term rentals) [13][14][17].  \n    - 10% of gross revenues (long-term leases) [13][14][17].  \n    - 10% of total repair/upgrade/renovation charges [13][14][17].  \n    - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all fees/commissions/charges [13][14][17].\n\n- **Documents with fixed installment payments**:\n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n    - Total price $29,900.00, payable in three fixed installments of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 at defined milestones [4][5].\n\nNo other document in the provided corpus explicitly defines either a percentage-based fee schedule or a fixed installment payment plan in the same clear way.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is centered on ongoing service and management, so its compensation is structured as percentages of revenue and charges (commissions and percentage-based fees) plus some fixed monthly/hourly amounts [13][14][17]. This aligns with a variable, performance-linked fee model.\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is a one-time sale and installation of equipment, so its financial structure is a fixed total price broken into milestone-based installments [4][5], aligning with a fixed, project-based payment model.\n- Other documents (warranty, holding tank contract, invoice) mention payments or costs but do not define them as either percentage-based fee schedules or installment plans in the same explicit way [1][2][3][9][12].\n\nThese distinctions directly answer the original comparison between “percentage-based fee structure” and “fixed installment payments.”\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the document that explicitly uses a **percentage-based fee structure**, including 25% and 10% commissions on gross revenues, 10% on repair/upgrade charges, and a 4.712% excise tax on all such fees [13][14][17].\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that explicitly uses **fixed installment payments**, specifying a total price of $29,900.00 payable in three fixed installments of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 tied to signing, delivery, and completion [4][5].",

the property management agreement is the document that explicitly uses a percentage-based fee structure including 25% and 10% commissions on gross revenues 10% on repair/upgrade charges and a 4.712% excise tax on all such fees 131417. - the purchase contract is the document that explicitly uses fixed installment payments specifying a total price of $29900.00 payable in three fixed installments of $20000 $7000 and $2900 tied to signing delivery and completion 45.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1: Percentage-based “fees” concepts in each relevant document\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\nThis document contains multiple fee concepts that are explicitly percentage-based:\n\n- “A fee/commission of twenty five percent (25%) of the gross revenues for management services for short term and/or vacation rentals” [13][14][17].  \n- “A fee/commission of ten percent (10%) of the gross revenues for management services for long term leases” [13][14][17].  \n- “A fee of ten percent (10%) on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations” [13][14][17].  \n\nAll three are clearly percentage-based fee structures (percent of gross revenues or total charges).\n\nIt also includes a tax that is percentage-based:\n\n- “the Agent will assess/charge the Owner the Hawaii Gross Excise tax (currently at 4.712%) on all the above fees, commissions and charges” [13][14][17].\n\nOther fees in this document are fixed dollar amounts (see Q2), but the above are explicitly percentage-based.\n\n**Other documents**\n\n- **PURCHASE CONTRACT**: Describes a total contract price of $29,900.00 “payable in 3 installments” of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 [4][5]. These are fixed amounts, not percentages. No percentage-based fee structure is described.\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: Refers generally to “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon” [12], but does not specify any percentage-based fee.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY / coverage**: Discusses arbitration costs (“Each party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration” [1][2][3])—this is a cost-sharing fraction, not a fee structure tied to a base amount like revenue, and no percentage-based “fee” schedule is laid out.\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Lists unit prices and totals for items, with a subtotal and “TAX N/A” [9]; no percentage-based fee is specified.\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** and **purchase_contract** do not define any percentage-of-revenue or similar fee structure.\n\nThus, the only document that clearly uses percentage-based fee structures for “fees” is the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** [13][14][17].\n\n---\n\n### Q2: Fixed installment payment “fees” concepts in each relevant document\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT**\n\nThe payment terms are explicitly structured as fixed installments:\n\n- “Total contract price is $29,900.00, payable in 3 installments:  \n  · $20,000.00 upon signing  \n  · $7,000.00 upon delivery  \n  · $2,900.00 upon completion” [4][5].\n\nThese are fixed dollar amounts tied to milestones, i.e., a fixed installment payment structure.\n\n**Other documents**\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**: Contains fixed monthly and hourly charges (e.g., “$75.00/month” for advertising, “$50.00/month” for administration, “$35/hour” for certain services, and a one-time “two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)” start-up fee [13][14][17]). These are fixed fees, but they are not described as a finite series of installments toward a total contract price; they are ongoing or one-time charges, not an installment payment plan.\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Shows a one-time “AMOUNT DUE 29900.00” [9], not broken into installments.\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: Refers to paying “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s)” [12], but does not specify installments.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY / coverage**: No installment payment structure is described; only cost-sharing for arbitration (each party pays half of arbitration costs) [1][2][3].\n\nTherefore, the **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that explicitly uses fixed installment payments.\n\n---\n\n### Q3: Comparison – which doc uses percentage-based fees vs fixed installment payments?\n\n- **Percentage-based fee structure**:  \n  The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** uses percentage-based fees for:\n  - 25% of gross revenues for short-term/vacation rental management [13][14][17].  \n  - 10% of gross revenues for long-term lease management [13][14][17].  \n  - 10% of the total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations [13][14][17].  \n  - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all those fees and charges [13][14][17].\n\n- **Fixed installment payments**:  \n  The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** uses fixed installment payments:\n  - Total price $29,900.00, payable in three fixed installments of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 at specified milestones [4][5].\n\nNo other document combines “fees” with an explicit percentage-of-base structure or a defined installment schedule in the same way.\n\n---\n\n### Q4: For each “fees” concept, does the document specify percentage-based structure?\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT – fee concepts and whether percentage-based**\n\n- Credit card/bankcard fees deducted from Owner’s proceeds [13][14][17]:  \n  Mentioned, but no percentage rate is specified in the text.\n- 25% commission on gross revenues for short-term/vacation rentals – explicitly percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- 10% commission on gross revenues for long-term leases – explicitly percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- 10% fee on total charge for repairs/upgrades/renovations – explicitly percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- Advertising charge: $75.00/month – fixed amount, not percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- Administration/accounting: $50.00/month – fixed amount, not percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- $35/hour charge for scheduling/escorting contractors – fixed hourly rate, not percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- Hawaii Gross Excise tax at 4.712% on all the above fees/commissions/charges – explicitly percentage-based [13][14][17].\n- Agency start-up fee: $250.00 – fixed amount, not percentage-based [13][14][17].\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT – fee concepts**\n\n- Total contract price and its installments are fixed dollar amounts [4][5]; no percentage-based fee is specified.\n\n**Other docs**\n\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: “charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon” [12] – no percentage structure specified.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY / coverage**: “Each party shall be responsible to pay for one-half (1/2) of the cost and fees of the arbitration” [1][2][3] – this is a 50/50 cost split, but not a fee schedule tied to a revenue or contract base; it is a cost allocation rule, not a recurring fee concept like commissions.\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Lists prices and totals [9]; no percentage-based fee structure.\n\n---\n\n### Q5: For each “fees” concept, does the document specify fixed installment payments?\n\n**PURCHASE CONTRACT**\n\n- The only explicit installment structure is the payment of the total contract price in three fixed installments: $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, $2,900 upon completion [4][5].  \n  These are clearly fixed installment payments.\n\n**PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**\n\n- Fees like $75/month, $50/month, and $35/hour are fixed recurring or hourly charges [13][14][17], but they are not described as a finite series of installments toward a defined total; they are ongoing service fees. The $250 start-up fee is a one-time fixed payment [13][14][17]. None of these are framed as “installments” of a larger fixed price.\n\n**Other docs**\n\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: One-time amount due [9], no installments.\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: Payment of “charges incurred” [12], no installment schedule.\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY / coverage**: No installment payment structure.\n\nThus, only the **PURCHASE CONTRACT** explicitly uses fixed installment payments.\n\n---\n\n### Q6: Which specific documents use percentage-based fee structures vs fixed installment payments?\n\n- **Documents with percentage-based fee structures**:\n  - **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (including its full version [17] and the fee excerpt [13][14]):  \n    - 25% of gross revenues (short-term rentals) [13][14][17].  \n    - 10% of gross revenues (long-term leases) [13][14][17].  \n    - 10% of total repair/upgrade/renovation charges [13][14][17].  \n    - 4.712% Hawaii Gross Excise tax on all fees/commissions/charges [13][14][17].\n\n- **Documents with fixed installment payments**:\n  - **PURCHASE CONTRACT**:  \n    - Total price $29,900.00, payable in three fixed installments of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 at defined milestones [4][5].\n\nNo other document in the provided corpus explicitly defines either a percentage-based fee schedule or a fixed installment payment plan in the same clear way.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is centered on ongoing service and management, so its compensation is structured as percentages of revenue and charges (commissions and percentage-based fees) plus some fixed monthly/hourly amounts [13][14][17]. This aligns with a variable, performance-linked fee model.\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is a one-time sale and installation of equipment, so its financial structure is a fixed total price broken into milestone-based installments [4][5], aligning with a fixed, project-based payment model.\n- Other documents (warranty, holding tank contract, invoice) mention payments or costs but do not define them as either percentage-based fee schedules or installment plans in the same explicit way [1][2][3][9][12].\n\nThese distinctions directly answer the original comparison between “percentage-based fee structure” and “fixed installment payments.”\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the document that explicitly uses a **percentage-based fee structure**, including 25% and 10% commissions on gross revenues, 10% on repair/upgrade charges, and a 4.712% excise tax on all such fees [13][14][17].\n- The **PURCHASE CONTRACT** is the document that explicitly uses **fixed installment payments**, specifying a total price of $29,900.00 payable in three fixed installments of $20,000, $7,000, and $2,900 tied to signing, delivery, and completion [4][5].",

Risk of Loss  \n> Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\nThis clause clearly allocates who bears the risk if the lift is damaged or destroyed at different points in time: the Contractor bears that risk before delivery; once delivery occurs, the Customer bears it.[10][11]\n\nNo other documents in the provided set use the phrase “risk of loss” or an equivalent explicit allocation of casualty risk (e.g., “risk of damage,” “risk of destruction”) in the same direct way. The Builder’s Limited Warranty and the Property Management Agreement allocate responsibility and liability in other ways (warranty scope, exclusions, indemnity), but they do not contain a separate, explicit “risk of loss” clause comparable to the Purchase Contract’s Section 5.[1][4][10][11]\n\nAccordingly, the specific “risk of loss” statement that functions as a risk allocation mechanism is:\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Risk of Loss Clause**  \n  “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n### Q2 & Q6 – “Liability limitations” statements tied to risk allocation\n\nThere are several provisions that limit or allocate liability and thus function as “liability limitation” risk allocation mechanisms, even though they are not labeled “Limitation of Liability.”\n\n1. **Property Management Agreement – Hold Harmless / Indemnity**\n\n   > “HOLD HARMLESS. The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5]\n\n   This clause:\n   - **Limits the Agent’s liability** for “any claim for loss or injury to any person or property” on the property, except where caused by the Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.[1][5]\n   - **Affirmatively shifts risk** to the Owner by requiring the Owner to “hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent” for such claims.[1][5]  \n   This is a classic liability limitation and risk allocation provision.\n\n2. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Exclusions from Coverage**\n\n   The Builder’s Limited Warranty contains a detailed “Exclusions from Coverage” section that limits the Builder’s responsibility for various types of damage and loss:\n\n   - “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.”[2][3][4]\n   - “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.”[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of damage from wear and tear, abuse, lack of maintenance, acts of God, etc.[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of “Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.”[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.”[2][3][4]\n\n   These provisions:\n   - **Limit the Builder’s liability** by specifying categories of damage and claims for which the Builder “does not assume responsibility.”[2][3][4]\n   - **Exclude consequential or incidental damages**, which is a standard limitation-of-liability technique.[2][3][4]\n   - **Tie coverage to timely written notice**, effectively limiting liability to claims made within the warranty period.[2][3][4]\n\n3. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – No Other Warranties / Disclaimer**\n\n   > “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH INCLUDE (BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO COVER THE PRESENCE OF RADON OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4][5]\n\n   This clause:\n   - **Disclaims implied warranties**, thereby limiting the Builder’s potential liability to the express terms of the limited warranty.[2][3][4][5]\n   - Narrows the scope of legally enforceable obligations, which is a form of liability limitation and risk allocation.\n\n4. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Limitation of Liability via Notice Requirement**\n\n   The notification clause further limits liability:\n\n   > “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[2][3][4]\n\n   This:\n   - **Conditions the Builder’s liability** on prompt notice, shifting the risk of additional damage (and even initial liability) to the Buyer/Owner if they fail to notify promptly.[2][3][4]\n\n5. **Property Management Agreement – Insurance Requirement**\n\n   While not a classic “limitation of liability” clause, the Owner’s obligation to carry liability insurance with the Agent as an additional insured also functions as a risk allocation mechanism:\n\n   > “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured and shall be furnished with a copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance.”[1]\n\n   This:\n   - **Shifts financial risk** of third-party claims to the Owner’s insurer and protects the Agent by naming it as an additional insured.[1]\n   - Operates in tandem with the hold harmless clause to allocate liability away from the Agent and onto the Owner/Owner’s insurance.[1][5]\n\nCollectively, these provisions are the “liability limitations” statements explicitly tied to risk allocation.\n\n### Q3 & Q7 – “Non-transferability” statements tied to risk allocation\n\nThe Builder’s Limited Warranty contains an explicit non-transferability clause:\n\n> “8. Not Transferable. This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\nThis clause:\n- **Restricts the benefit of the warranty** to the original Buyer/Owner only.[2][3][4]\n- **Terminates the warranty** upon sale or move-out, so subsequent owners cannot claim under it.[2][3][4]\n\nBy doing so, it allocates the risk of defects arising after transfer of the property:\n- The **Builder’s risk is limited** to the period and relationship with the first purchaser.[2][3][4]\n- **Subsequent owners bear the risk** of defects without recourse under this warranty, unless they negotiate separate protections.[2][3][4]\n\nThe Property Management Agreement’s “GOVERNING LAW” clause notes that the agreement “shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent,”[1][5] but this is the opposite of non-transferability (it affirms transferability) and does not function as a non-transferability risk allocation clause. The Purchase Contract’s “Assignment” clause states:\n\n> “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\nThis is an **anti-assignment** provision, but it is a general contract control clause rather than explicitly framed as a risk allocation mechanism for loss or liability. It controls who can step into the contractual relationship, but it does not itself allocate risk of loss or liability in the way the warranty non-transferability clause does.[10][11]\n\nThus, the specific “non-transferability” statement that functions as a risk allocation mechanism is:\n\n- **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Not Transferable Clause**  \n  “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\n### Q4 & Q8 – How the three types of statements function collectively as different risk allocation mechanisms\n\nPutting the above together, the three categories operate as distinct but complementary risk allocation mechanisms:\n\n1. **Risk of Loss Clause (Purchase Contract)**\n\n   - **Mechanism:** Temporal allocation of casualty risk.  \n     “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n   - **Function:** Determines who bears the financial consequences if the lift is damaged or destroyed at different stages (pre‑delivery vs. post‑delivery).[10][11]\n   - **Distinct role:** Allocates **property/casualty risk over time** in relation to performance and delivery, independent of fault.\n\n2. **Liability Limitation Clauses (Property Management Agreement & Builder’s Warranty)**\n\n   - **Mechanisms:**\n     - Hold harmless and indemnity in favor of the Agent, with an exception only for gross negligence or willful misconduct.[1][5]\n     - Exclusions from coverage for many categories of damage and claims, including consequential damages and bodily injury/property damage outside the defined scope.[2][3][4]\n     - Disclaimers of implied warranties, limiting obligations to the express warranty.[2][3][4][5]\n     - Notice requirements that relieve the Builder of “all liability” if not met.[2][3][4]\n     - Insurance requirements naming the Agent as an additional insured.[1]\n   - **Function:** These clauses:\n     - **Cap or exclude categories of liability** (e.g., no consequential damages, no responsibility for certain causes of loss).[2][3][4]\n     - **Shift liability** for third-party claims and on‑site injuries from the Agent to the Owner (and the Owner’s insurer).[1][5]\n     - **Condition and narrow the Builder’s obligations**, reducing the Builder’s exposure to defects and related damages.[2][3][4][5]\n   - **Distinct role:** Allocate **legal liability and financial exposure** for claims and damages, primarily by limiting the scope of responsibility and shifting it to the other party or their insurer.\n\n3. **Non-Transferability Clause (Builder’s Warranty)**\n\n   - **Mechanism:** Restriction of who can benefit from the warranty and for how long.\n     - Warranty “is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable.”[2][3][4]\n     - Warranty “automatically terminates” upon sale or move‑out.[2][3][4]\n   - **Function:** \n     - **Confines the Builder’s risk** to a defined relationship (first purchaser) and period.[2][3][4]\n     - **Shifts risk of later defects** to subsequent owners, who cannot rely on this warranty.[2][3][4]\n   - **Distinct role:** Allocates **inter‑party and inter‑owner risk over the life of the asset**, by controlling who can assert claims and when.\n\nTaken together:\n\n- The **risk of loss clause** answers: *Who bears the risk if the thing is damaged at different times?*[10][11]\n- The **liability limitation clauses** answer: *For what kinds of losses and claims will a party be legally responsible, and to what extent?*[1][2][3][4][5]\n- The **non-transferability clause** answers: *Which parties (and which owners over time) can enforce these protections, and when does that right end?*[2][3][4]\n\nEach type of clause addresses a different dimension of risk—time of loss, scope of liability, and identity of the protected party—so they collectively form a layered risk allocation framework across the documents.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Temporal vs. substantive vs. relational risk:**\n  - Temporal: The Purchase Contract’s risk of loss clause allocates risk based on the timing of delivery.[10][11]\n  - Substantive: The Builder’s warranty exclusions, disclaimers, and notice requirements, and the Property Management Agreement’s hold harmless and insurance provisions, allocate which types of losses and claims each party bears.[1][2][3][4][5]\n  - Relational: The non-transferability clause in the Builder’s warranty allocates risk based on who owns the property and whether they are the original purchaser.[2][3][4]\n\n- **Interaction between liability limitations and insurance:**\n  - The Property Management Agreement both limits the Agent’s liability and requires the Owner to carry liability insurance naming the Agent as an additional insured,[1][5] reinforcing the shift of risk away from the Agent and onto the Owner/Owner’s insurer.\n\n- **Interaction between warranty scope and non-transferability:**\n  - The Builder’s warranty first narrows the Builder’s obligations via exclusions and disclaimers,[2][3][4][5] then further limits who can enforce those obligations via the non-transferability clause.[2][3][4] Together, they tightly control the Builder’s risk exposure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the set, the three different “risk allocation” statements are:\n\n1. **Risk of Loss Statement**  \n   - Purchase Contract, Section 5:  \n     “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n2. **Liability Limitation Statements**  \n   - Property Management Agreement – Hold Harmless / Indemnity:  \n     “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5]  \n   - Property Management Agreement – Insurance Requirement:  \n     Owner must “[p]rovide Liability Insurance coverage for the property… [and] [t]he Agent shall be named as additional insured.”[1]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty – Exclusions from Coverage and consequential/ incidental damages exclusion.[2][3][4]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty – “No Other Warranties” disclaimer of implied warranties.[2][3][4][5]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty – Notice requirement relieving Builder of “all liability” if not promptly notified.[2][3][4]\n\n3. **Non-Transferability Statement**  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty, Section 8:  \n     “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\nThese three types of provisions—risk of loss, liability limitations, and non-transferability—operate as distinct but complementary mechanisms to allocate risk across the contracts: by time (pre‑ vs. post‑delivery), by type and scope of liability, and by which parties and owners over time can claim protection.",

limits the agents liability for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property on the property except where caused by the agents gross negligence or willful misconduct.15 - affirmatively shifts risk to the owner by requiring the owner to hold agent harmless and indemnify agent for such claims.15 this is a classic liability limitation and risk allocation provision. 2. builders limited warranty  exclusions from coverage the builders limited warranty contains a detailed exclusions from coverage section that limits the builders responsibility for various types of damage and loss: - the builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.234 - consequential or incidental damages.234 - exclusion of damage from wear and tear abuse lack of maintenance acts of god etc.234 - exclusion of bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by builder.234 - exclusion of any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one 1 year or sixty 60 day warranty period as applicable.234 these provisions: - limit the builders liability by specifying categories of damage and claims for which the builder does not assume responsibility.234 - exclude consequential or incidental damages which is a standard limitation-of-liability technique.234 -

The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5]\n\n   This clause:\n   - **Limits the Agent’s liability** for “any claim for loss or injury to any person or property” on the property, except where caused by the Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.[1][5]\n   - **Affirmatively shifts risk** to the Owner by requiring the Owner to “hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent” for such claims.[1][5]  \n   This is a classic liability limitation and risk allocation provision.\n\n2. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Exclusions from Coverage**\n\n   The Builder’s Limited Warranty contains a detailed “Exclusions from Coverage” section that limits the Builder’s responsibility for various types of damage and loss:\n\n   - “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.”[2][3][4]\n   - “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.”[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of damage from wear and tear, abuse, lack of maintenance, acts of God, etc.[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of “Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.”[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of “Any and all claims not made in writing as provided herein prior to one (1) year or sixty (60) day warranty period, as applicable.”[2][3][4]\n\n   These provisions:\n   - **Limit the Builder’s liability** by specifying categories of damage and claims for which the Builder “does not assume responsibility.”[2][3][4]\n   - **Exclude consequential or incidental damages**, which is a standard limitation-of-liability technique.[2][3][4]\n   - **Tie coverage to timely written notice**, effectively limiting liability to claims made within the warranty period.[2][3][4]\n\n3. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – No Other Warranties / Disclaimer**\n\n   > “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH INCLUDE (BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO COVER THE PRESENCE OF RADON OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4][5]\n\n   This clause:\n   - **Disclaims implied warranties**, thereby limiting the Builder’s potential liability to the express terms of the limited warranty.[2][3][4][5]\n   - Narrows the scope of legally enforceable obligations, which is a form of liability limitation and risk allocation.\n\n4. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Limitation of Liability via Notice Requirement**\n\n   The notification clause further limits liability:\n\n   > “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[2][3][4]\n\n   This:\n   - **Conditions the Builder’s liability** on prompt notice, shifting the risk of additional damage (and even initial liability) to the Buyer/Owner if they fail to notify promptly.[2][3][4]\n\n5. **Property Management Agreement – Insurance Requirement**\n\n   While not a classic “limitation of liability” clause, the Owner’s obligation to carry liability insurance with the Agent as an additional insured also functions as a risk allocation mechanism:\n\n   > “Provide Liability Insurance coverage for the property with minimum limits of $300,000 for bodily injury and $25,000 for property damage to others. The Agent shall be named as additional insured and shall be furnished with a copy of the insurance policy and a certificate of insurance.”[1]\n\n   This:\n   - **Shifts financial risk** of third-party claims to the Owner’s insurer and protects the Agent by naming it as an additional insured.[1]\n   - Operates in tandem with the hold harmless clause to allocate liability away from the Agent and onto the Owner/Owner’s insurance.[1][5]\n\nCollectively, these provisions are the “liability limitations” statements explicitly tied to risk allocation.\n\n### Q3 & Q7 – “Non-transferability” statements tied to risk allocation\n\nThe Builder’s Limited Warranty contains an explicit non-transferability clause:\n\n> “8. Not Transferable. This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\nThis clause:\n- **Restricts the benefit of the warranty** to the original Buyer/Owner only.[2][3][4]\n- **Terminates the warranty** upon sale or move-out, so subsequent owners cannot claim under it.[2][3][4]\n\nBy doing so, it allocates the risk of defects arising after transfer of the property:\n- The **Builder’s risk is limited** to the period and relationship with the first purchaser.[2][3][4]\n- **Subsequent owners bear the risk** of defects without recourse under this warranty, unless they negotiate separate protections.[2][3][4]\n\nThe Property Management Agreement’s “GOVERNING LAW” clause notes that the agreement “shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent,”[1][5] but this is the opposite of non-transferability (it affirms transferability) and does not function as a non-transferability risk allocation clause. The Purchase Contract’s “Assignment” clause states:\n\n> “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\nThis is an **anti-assignment** provision, but it is a general contract control clause rather than explicitly framed as a risk allocation mechanism for loss or liability. It controls who can step into the contractual relationship, but it does not itself allocate risk of loss or liability in the way the warranty non-transferability clause does.[10][11]\n\nThus, the specific “non-transferability” statement that functions as a risk allocation mechanism is:\n\n- **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Not Transferable Clause**  \n  “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\n### Q4 & Q8 – How the three types of statements function collectively as different risk allocation mechanisms\n\nPutting the above together, the three categories operate as distinct but complementary risk allocation mechanisms:\n\n1. **Risk of Loss Clause (Purchase Contract)**\n\n   - **Mechanism:** Temporal allocation of casualty risk.  \n     “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n   - **Function:** Determines who bears the financial consequences if the lift is damaged or destroyed at different stages (pre‑delivery vs. post‑delivery).[10][11]\n   - **Distinct role:** Allocates **property/casualty risk over time** in relation to performance and delivery, independent of fault.\n\n2. **Liability Limitation Clauses (Property Management Agreement & Builder’s Warranty)**\n\n   - **Mechanisms:**\n     - Hold harmless and indemnity in favor of the Agent, with an exception only for gross negligence or willful misconduct.[1][5]\n     - Exclusions from coverage for many categories of damage and claims, including consequential damages and bodily injury/property damage outside the defined scope.[2][3][4]\n     - Disclaimers of implied warranties, limiting obligations to the express warranty.[2][3][4][5]\n     - Notice requirements that relieve the Builder of “all liability” if not met.[2][3][4]\n     - Insurance requirements naming the Agent as an additional insured.[1]\n   - **Function:** These clauses:\n     - **Cap or exclude categories of liability** (e.g., no consequential damages, no responsibility for certain causes of loss).[2][3][4]\n     - **Shift liability** for third-party claims and on‑site injuries from the Agent to the Owner (and the Owner’s insurer).[1][5]\n     - **Condition and narrow the Builder’s obligations**, reducing the Builder’s exposure to defects and related damages.[2][3][4][5]\n   - **Distinct role:** Allocate **legal liability and financial exposure** for claims and damages, primarily by limiting the scope of responsibility and shifting it to the other party or their insurer.\n\n3. **Non-Transferability Clause (Builder’s Warranty)**\n\n   - **Mechanism:** Restriction of who can benefit from the warranty and for how long.\n     - Warranty “is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable.”[2][3][4]\n     - Warranty “automatically terminates” upon sale or move‑out.[2][3][4]\n   - **Function:** \n     - **Confines the Builder’s risk** to a defined relationship (first purchaser) and period.[2][3][4]\n     - **Shifts risk of later defects** to subsequent owners, who cannot rely on this warranty.[2][3][4]\n   - **Distinct role:** Allocates **inter‑party and inter‑owner risk over the life of the asset**, by controlling who can assert claims and when.\n\nTaken together:\n\n- The **risk of loss clause** answers: *Who bears the risk if the thing is damaged at different times?*[10][11]\n- The **liability limitation clauses** answer: *For what kinds of losses and claims will a party be legally responsible, and to what extent?*[1][2][3][4][5]\n- The **non-transferability clause** answers: *Which parties (and which owners over time) can enforce these protections, and when does that right end?*[2][3][4]\n\nEach type of clause addresses a different dimension of risk—time of loss, scope of liability, and identity of the protected party—so they collectively form a layered risk allocation framework across the documents.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Temporal vs. substantive vs. relational risk:**\n  - Temporal: The Purchase Contract’s risk of loss clause allocates risk based on the timing of delivery.[10][11]\n  - Substantive: The Builder’s warranty exclusions, disclaimers, and notice requirements, and the Property Management Agreement’s hold harmless and insurance provisions, allocate which types of losses and claims each party bears.[1][2][3][4][5]\n  - Relational: The non-transferability clause in the Builder’s warranty allocates risk based on who owns the property and whether they are the original purchaser.[2][3][4]\n\n- **Interaction between liability limitations and insurance:**\n  - The Property Management Agreement both limits the Agent’s liability and requires the Owner to carry liability insurance naming the Agent as an additional insured,[1][5] reinforcing the shift of risk away from the Agent and onto the Owner/Owner’s insurer.\n\n- **Interaction between warranty scope and non-transferability:**\n  - The Builder’s warranty first narrows the Builder’s obligations via exclusions and disclaimers,[2][3][4][5] then further limits who can enforce those obligations via the non-transferability clause.[2][3][4] Together, they tightly control the Builder’s risk exposure.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the set, the three different “risk allocation” statements are:\n\n1. **Risk of Loss Statement**  \n   - Purchase Contract, Section 5:  \n     “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n2. **Liability Limitation Statements**  \n   - Property Management Agreement – Hold Harmless / Indemnity:  \n     “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5]  \n   - Property Management Agreement – Insurance Requirement:  \n     Owner must “[p]rovide Liability Insurance coverage for the property… [and] [t]he Agent shall be named as additional insured.”[1]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty – Exclusions from Coverage and consequential/ incidental damages exclusion.[2][3][4]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty – “No Other Warranties” disclaimer of implied warranties.[2][3][4][5]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty – Notice requirement relieving Builder of “all liability” if not promptly notified.[2][3][4]\n\n3. **Non-Transferability Statement**  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty, Section 8:  \n     “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\nThese three types of provisions—risk of loss, liability limitations, and non-transferability—operate as distinct but complementary mechanisms to allocate risk across the contracts: by time (pre‑ vs. post‑delivery), by type and scope of liability, and by which parties and owners over time can claim protection.",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1. What “risk allocation” statements appear across the set?\n\nAcross the documents, the provisions that allocate risk between the parties fall into three conceptual buckets:\n\n1. **Risk of loss** – who bears the risk if the goods are damaged or lost.\n2. **Liability limitations / exclusions** – who bears (or does not bear) responsibility for certain damages or claims.\n3. **Non‑transferability / assignment restrictions** – who can transfer rights or obligations, and when.\n\nConcrete instances in the evidence:\n\n- **Risk of loss**\n  - Purchase Contract – explicit “Risk of Loss” clause:  \n    “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n- **Liability limitations / exclusions**\n  - Property Management Agreement – “HOLD HARMLESS” clause:  \n    “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property … except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5][6]\n  - Builder’s Limited Warranty – exclusions and disclaimers:\n    - Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages: “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES” are excluded from coverage.[2][3][4]\n    - Exclusion of bodily injury and certain property damage: “Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home …” is excluded.[2][3][4]\n    - Broad disclaimer of other warranties: “ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES … ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4]\n\n- **Non‑transferability / assignment restrictions**\n  - Builder’s Limited Warranty – non‑transferability:  \n    “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n  - Purchase Contract – assignment restriction:  \n    “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\nThese are the operative “risk allocation” statements in the set.\n\n---\n\n### Q2 & Q7. Which statements address “risk of loss,” and how is that risk allocated?\n\nThe only explicit “risk of loss” clause appears in the **Purchase Contract**:\n\n- **Text**: “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n**Allocation mechanics:**\n\n- **Before delivery**: The **Contractor** bears the risk of loss or damage to the lift and related equipment.[10][11]\n- **After delivery**: Once delivery occurs, the **Customer** bears the risk of loss.[10][11]\n\n**Timing / triggering event:**\n\n- The trigger is **“delivery”** – risk shifts at that point from Contractor to Customer.[10][11]\n- There is no further subdivision by type of loss; the clause is broad and categorical.\n\nNo other document uses the phrase “risk of loss” or an equivalent explicit allocation of physical loss of goods. The Builder’s Limited Warranty exclusions (e.g., for damage caused by insects, fire, acts of God, etc.)[2][3][4] functionally allocate who bears certain types of loss, but they are framed as **warranty coverage exclusions**, not as a classic “risk of loss” clause. They are better treated under liability limitations (Q3) rather than pure risk‑of‑loss allocation.\n\n---\n\n### Q3. Which statements address “liability limitations,” and what limits/caps do they impose?\n\nThere are several liability‑limiting provisions, though none sets a numeric “cap”; instead they **exclude categories of liability** or **shift responsibility**.\n\n1. **Property Management Agreement – Hold Harmless / Indemnity**  \n   - “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property … except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5][6]\n\n   **Effect:**\n   - The Agent’s liability is **limited** to losses caused by its **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.[1][5][6]\n   - For all other loss or injury on the property, the **Owner** bears the risk and must **indemnify** the Agent.[1][5][6]\n   - This is a classic limitation of liability and risk‑shifting clause.\n\n2. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Exclusions from Coverage**  \n   - Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages:  \n     “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES” are excluded from coverage.[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of certain causes and types of damage, including:\n     - Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, non‑residential use.[2][3][4]\n     - Defects due to material characteristics (e.g., warping, cracking).[2][3][4]\n     - Loss or damage caused by insects, animals, fire, explosion, water escape, ground movement, wind, hail, flood, earthquakes, acts of God.[2][3][4]\n     - Bodily injury or damage to personal property or to real property not part of the original home.[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of claims not timely made in writing within the warranty period.[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of defects in items not part of the original home or caused by others’ negligence or improper maintenance.[2][3][4]\n\n   **Effect:**\n   - The Builder’s liability under the warranty is **narrowed** to a defined set of defects; many categories of damage and consequential losses are **excluded**.[2][3][4]\n   - The Buyer/Owner bears the risk for excluded categories (e.g., consequential damages, acts of God, bodily injury).[2][3][4]\n\n3. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – No Other Warranties / Disclaimer**  \n   - “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES … ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4]\n\n   **Effect:**\n   - The Builder **disclaims** all implied warranties (merchantability, fitness, habitability, etc.), limiting its obligations strictly to the express limited warranty.[2][3][4]\n   - This is a broad **limitation of liability** by eliminating other potential warranty‑based claims.\n\n4. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Failure to Notify of Emergency**  \n   - “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[2][3][4]\n\n   **Effect:**\n   - If the Buyer/Owner does not promptly notify the Builder of an emergency, the Builder’s liability for that issue is **completely cut off**.[2][3][4]\n\nCollectively, these provisions limit the Builder’s and Agent’s exposure and allocate the residual risk to the Owner/Buyer.\n\n---\n\n### Q4. Which statements address “non‑transferability,” and what restrictions do they impose?\n\nTwo types of non‑transferability / assignment restrictions appear:\n\n1. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Non‑Transferable Warranty**  \n   - “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\n   **Restrictions:**\n   - Only the **first purchaser** (original Buyer/Owner) can benefit from the warranty.[2][3][4]\n   - The warranty **cannot be assigned** or transferred to a subsequent purchaser.[2][3][4]\n   - The warranty **automatically terminates** upon sale of the home or the first purchaser moving out.[2][3][4]\n\n   **Risk allocation effect:**\n   - Subsequent owners bear the risk of defects that would otherwise have been covered; the Builder’s obligations are limited to the first purchaser.[2][3][4]\n\n2. **Purchase Contract – Assignment Clause**  \n   - “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\n   **Restrictions:**\n   - Both Contractor and Customer are **prohibited from assigning** the contract unilaterally.[10][11]\n   - Assignment is only permitted with **mutual written consent**.[10][11]\n\n   **Risk allocation effect:**\n   - Each party bears the risk that it must perform (or receive performance) personally unless the other party agrees to an assignment.[10][11]\n   - This prevents either party from shifting contractual risk to a third party without the counterparty’s approval.\n\n---\n\n### Q5 & Q6. What are the three different “risk allocation” statements, and on what basis are they distinguished?\n\nAcross the set, the three distinct **types** of risk allocation statements are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**\n   - Example: “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n   - **Basis of distinction**:\n     - Addresses **physical loss or damage to goods**.\n     - Allocation is based on a **temporal trigger** (delivery).\n     - Legal effect: determines which party bears economic loss if the goods are damaged at different stages.\n\n2. **Liability limitations**\n   - Examples:\n     - Hold harmless / indemnity: Agent not liable except for gross negligence or willful misconduct; Owner must indemnify Agent.[1][5][6]\n     - Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages and various categories of damage in the Builder’s warranty.[2][3][4]\n     - Disclaimer of all other warranties.[2][3][4]\n     - Loss of coverage if emergency is not promptly reported.[2][3][4]\n   - **Basis of distinction**:\n     - Addresses **legal responsibility for damages or claims** (contractual and sometimes tort‑related).\n     - Mechanism is **exclusion, limitation, or shifting** of liability categories, not timing of physical loss.\n     - Legal effect: narrows or reallocates the scope of recoverable damages and enforceable obligations.\n\n3. **Non‑transferability / assignment restrictions**\n   - Examples:\n     - Warranty “is not transferable” and terminates upon sale or move‑out.[2][3][4]\n     - “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n   - **Basis of distinction**:\n     - Addresses **who may hold and enforce rights or obligations** under the contract.\n     - Mechanism is **prohibiting or conditioning transfer** of rights/obligations.\n     - Legal effect: confines risk and benefit to the original parties (or to those approved by consent), and cuts off rights for later owners or assignees.\n\nEach concrete clause can be categorized accordingly:\n\n- **Risk of loss**: Purchase Contract §5 “Risk of Loss.”[10][11]\n- **Liability limitations**: Property Management “Hold Harmless”[1][5][6]; Builder’s Warranty exclusions and disclaimers.[2][3][4]\n- **Non‑transferability**: Builder’s Warranty “Not Transferable”[2][3][4]; Purchase Contract “Assignment.”[10][11]\n\n---\n\n### Q8. On what basis are risk of loss, liability limitations, and non‑transferability distinguished?\n\nThey are distinguished by:\n\n1. **Type of risk addressed**\n   - Risk of loss: physical loss or damage to property/goods (who bears the economic loss when something is damaged).[10][11]\n   - Liability limitations: exposure to **claims and damages** (e.g., consequential damages, bodily injury, property damage, warranty claims).[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n   - Non‑transferability: risk associated with **who can enforce or be bound by the contract or warranty** (original parties vs. successors/assignees).[2][3][4][10][11]\n\n2. **Mechanism of allocation**\n   - Risk of loss: allocation by **event‑based transfer** (e.g., at “delivery”).[10][11]\n   - Liability limitations: allocation by **exclusion, limitation, indemnity, or disclaimer** of certain categories of damages or claims.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n   - Non‑transferability: allocation by **restricting assignment or transfer** of rights/obligations or terminating rights upon transfer of the underlying asset.[2][3][4][10][11]\n\n3. **Legal effect on parties’ rights and obligations**\n   - Risk of loss: determines which party must absorb losses from damage at different stages of performance.[10][11]\n   - Liability limitations: determines what kinds of damages can be recovered and from whom, and under what conditions (e.g., only for gross negligence).[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n   - Non‑transferability: determines **who** can claim benefits or is bound to perform; later purchasers or unapproved assignees may have **no rights** under the warranty or contract.[2][3][4][10][11]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **Purchase Contract** combines all three forms:\n  - Risk of loss allocation (Contractor vs. Customer, pre‑ and post‑delivery).[10][11]\n  - Assignment restriction (non‑transferability of the contract without consent).[10][11]\n  - Implicitly, by not expanding liability, it leaves general liability to background law, but the explicit risk‑of‑loss and assignment clauses are clear risk allocation tools.\n\n- The **Builder’s Limited Warranty** focuses on:\n  - **Liability limitations** via detailed exclusions and warranty disclaimers.[2][3][4]\n  - **Non‑transferability** via the “not transferable” clause and automatic termination upon sale or move‑out.[2][3][4]\n  - It does not use the phrase “risk of loss,” but its exclusions effectively allocate many categories of loss to the Buyer/Owner rather than the Builder.[2][3][4]\n\n- The **Property Management Agreement** contributes:\n  - A strong **liability limitation / indemnity** in favor of the Agent, shifting most property‑related loss and injury risk to the Owner.[1][5][6]\n\nTogether, these provisions show three distinct but complementary ways the parties allocate risk: by deciding who bears physical loss, who is legally liable for various damages, and who is allowed to hold or transfer the relevant rights and obligations.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe three different “risk allocation” statements across the set are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss statement**  \n   - “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” (Purchase Contract §5)[10][11]  \n   - Distinct because it allocates **physical loss risk** based on the timing of delivery.\n\n2. **Liability limitation statements**  \n   - Property Management “Hold Harmless” clause limiting Agent’s liability to gross negligence or willful misconduct and requiring Owner to indemnify Agent.[1][5][6]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty exclusions (e.g., consequential/incidentals, acts of God, bodily injury, certain property damage) and disclaimer of all other warranties.[2][3][4]  \n   - Distinct because they limit or exclude **legal liability and recoverable damages**, and shift responsibility for many losses to the Owner/Buyer.\n\n3. **Non‑transferability / assignment restriction statements**  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty “not transferable” clause, terminating the warranty upon sale or move‑out of the first purchaser.[2][3][4]  \n   - Purchase Contract assignment clause prohibiting assignment without the other party’s written consent.[10][11]  \n   - Distinct because they control **who may hold and enforce rights or obligations**, thereby allocating risk by confining benefits and burdens to specific parties.\n\nThese three categories—risk of loss, liability limitations, and non‑transferability—are distinguished by the type of risk they address, the mechanism they use to allocate that risk, and their legal effect on the parties’ rights and obligations.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1. What “risk allocation” statements appear across the set?\n\nAcross the documents, the provisions that allocate risk between the parties fall into three conceptual buckets:\n\n1. **Risk of loss** – who bears the risk if the goods are damaged or lost.\n2. **Liability limitations / exclusions** – who bears (or does not bear) responsibility for certain damages or claims.\n3. **Non‑transferability / assignment restrictions** – who can transfer rights or obligations, and when.\n\nConcrete instances in the evidence:\n\n- **Risk of loss**\n  - Purchase Contract – explicit “Risk of Loss” clause:  \n    “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n- **Liability limitations / exclusions**\n  - Property Management Agreement – “HOLD HARMLESS” clause:  \n    “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property … except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5][6]\n  - Builder’s Limited Warranty – exclusions and disclaimers:\n    - Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages: “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES” are excluded from coverage.[2][3][4]\n    - Exclusion of bodily injury and certain property damage: “Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home …” is excluded.[2][3][4]\n    - Broad disclaimer of other warranties: “ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES … ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4]\n\n- **Non‑transferability / assignment restrictions**\n  - Builder’s Limited Warranty – non‑transferability:  \n    “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n  - Purchase Contract – assignment restriction:  \n    “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\nThese are the operative “risk allocation” statements in the set.\n\n---\n\n### Q2 & Q7. Which statements address “risk of loss,” and how is that risk allocated?\n\nThe only explicit “risk of loss” clause appears in the **Purchase Contract**:\n\n- **Text**: “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n**Allocation mechanics:**\n\n- **Before delivery**: The **Contractor** bears the risk of loss or damage to the lift and related equipment.[10][11]\n- **After delivery**: Once delivery occurs, the **Customer** bears the risk of loss.[10][11]\n\n**Timing / triggering event:**\n\n- The trigger is **“delivery”** – risk shifts at that point from Contractor to Customer.[10][11]\n- There is no further subdivision by type of loss; the clause is broad and categorical.\n\nNo other document uses the phrase “risk of loss” or an equivalent explicit allocation of physical loss of goods. The Builder’s Limited Warranty exclusions (e.g., for damage caused by insects, fire, acts of God, etc.)[2][3][4] functionally allocate who bears certain types of loss, but they are framed as **warranty coverage exclusions**, not as a classic “risk of loss” clause. They are better treated under liability limitations (Q3) rather than pure risk‑of‑loss allocation.\n\n---\n\n### Q3. Which statements address “liability limitations,” and what limits/caps do they impose?\n\nThere are several liability‑limiting provisions, though none sets a numeric “cap”; instead they **exclude categories of liability** or **shift responsibility**.\n\n1. **Property Management Agreement – Hold Harmless / Indemnity**  \n   - “The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property … except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5][6]\n\n   **Effect:**\n   - The Agent’s liability is **limited** to losses caused by its **gross negligence or willful misconduct**.[1][5][6]\n   - For all other loss or injury on the property, the **Owner** bears the risk and must **indemnify** the Agent.[1][5][6]\n   - This is a classic limitation of liability and risk‑shifting clause.\n\n2. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Exclusions from Coverage**  \n   - Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages:  \n     “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES” are excluded from coverage.[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of certain causes and types of damage, including:\n     - Damage from ordinary wear and tear, abuse, neglect, lack of maintenance, non‑residential use.[2][3][4]\n     - Defects due to material characteristics (e.g., warping, cracking).[2][3][4]\n     - Loss or damage caused by insects, animals, fire, explosion, water escape, ground movement, wind, hail, flood, earthquakes, acts of God.[2][3][4]\n     - Bodily injury or damage to personal property or to real property not part of the original home.[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of claims not timely made in writing within the warranty period.[2][3][4]\n   - Exclusion of defects in items not part of the original home or caused by others’ negligence or improper maintenance.[2][3][4]\n\n   **Effect:**\n   - The Builder’s liability under the warranty is **narrowed** to a defined set of defects; many categories of damage and consequential losses are **excluded**.[2][3][4]\n   - The Buyer/Owner bears the risk for excluded categories (e.g., consequential damages, acts of God, bodily injury).[2][3][4]\n\n3. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – No Other Warranties / Disclaimer**  \n   - “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES … ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4]\n\n   **Effect:**\n   - The Builder **disclaims** all implied warranties (merchantability, fitness, habitability, etc.), limiting its obligations strictly to the express limited warranty.[2][3][4]\n   - This is a broad **limitation of liability** by eliminating other potential warranty‑based claims.\n\n4. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Failure to Notify of Emergency**  \n   - “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[2][3][4]\n\n   **Effect:**\n   - If the Buyer/Owner does not promptly notify the Builder of an emergency, the Builder’s liability for that issue is **completely cut off**.[2][3][4]\n\nCollectively, these provisions limit the Builder’s and Agent’s exposure and allocate the residual risk to the Owner/Buyer.\n\n---\n\n### Q4. Which statements address “non‑transferability,” and what restrictions do they impose?\n\nTwo types of non‑transferability / assignment restrictions appear:\n\n1. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Non‑Transferable Warranty**  \n   - “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\n   **Restrictions:**\n   - Only the **first purchaser** (original Buyer/Owner) can benefit from the warranty.[2][3][4]\n   - The warranty **cannot be assigned** or transferred to a subsequent purchaser.[2][3][4]\n   - The warranty **automatically terminates** upon sale of the home or the first purchaser moving out.[2][3][4]\n\n   **Risk allocation effect:**\n   - Subsequent owners bear the risk of defects that would otherwise have been covered; the Builder’s obligations are limited to the first purchaser.[2][3][4]\n\n2. **Purchase Contract – Assignment Clause**  \n   - “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\n   **Restrictions:**\n   - Both Contractor and Customer are **prohibited from assigning** the contract unilaterally.[10][11]\n   - Assignment is only permitted with **mutual written consent**.[10][11]\n\n   **Risk allocation effect:**\n   - Each party bears the risk that it must perform (or receive performance) personally unless the other party agrees to an assignment.[10][11]\n   - This prevents either party from shifting contractual risk to a third party without the counterparty’s approval.\n\n---\n\n### Q5 & Q6. What are the three different “risk allocation” statements, and on what basis are they distinguished?\n\nAcross the set, the three distinct **types** of risk allocation statements are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**\n   - Example: “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n   - **Basis of distinction**:\n     - Addresses **physical loss or damage to goods**.\n     - Allocation is based on a **temporal trigger** (delivery).\n     - Legal effect: determines which party bears economic loss if the goods are damaged at different stages.\n\n2. **Liability limitations**\n   - Examples:\n     - Hold harmless / indemnity: Agent not liable except for gross negligence or willful misconduct; Owner must indemnify Agent.[1][5][6]\n     - Exclusion of consequential or incidental damages and various categories of damage in the Builder’s warranty.[2][3][4]\n     - Disclaimer of all other warranties.[2][3][4]\n     - Loss of coverage if emergency is not promptly reported.[2][3][4]\n   - **Basis of distinction**:\n     - Addresses **legal responsibility for damages or claims** (contractual and sometimes tort‑related).\n     - Mechanism is **exclusion, limitation, or shifting** of liability categories, not timing of physical loss.\n     - Legal effect: narrows or reallocates the scope of recoverable damages and enforceable obligations.\n\n3. **Non‑transferability / assignment restrictions**\n   - Examples:\n     - Warranty “is not transferable” and terminates upon sale or move‑out.[2][3][4]\n     - “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n   - **Basis of distinction**:\n     - Addresses **who may hold and enforce rights or obligations** under the contract.\n     - Mechanism is **prohibiting or conditioning transfer** of rights/obligations.\n     - Legal effect: confines risk and benefit to the original parties (or to those approved by consent), and cuts off rights for later owners or assignees.\n\nEach concrete clause can be categorized accordingly:\n\n- **Risk of loss**: Purchase Contract §5 “Risk of Loss.”[10][11]\n- **Liability limitations**: Property Management “Hold Harmless”[1][5][6]; Builder’s Warranty exclusions and disclaimers.[2][3][4]\n- **Non‑transferability**: Builder’s Warranty “Not Transferable”[2][3][4]; Purchase Contract “Assignment.”[10][11]\n\n---\n\n### Q8. On what basis are risk of loss, liability limitations, and non‑transferability distinguished?\n\nThey are distinguished by:\n\n1. **Type of risk addressed**\n   - Risk of loss: physical loss or damage to property/goods (who bears the economic loss when something is damaged).[10][11]\n   - Liability limitations: exposure to **claims and damages** (e.g., consequential damages, bodily injury, property damage, warranty claims).[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n   - Non‑transferability: risk associated with **who can enforce or be bound by the contract or warranty** (original parties vs. successors/assignees).[2][3][4][10][11]\n\n2. **Mechanism of allocation**\n   - Risk of loss: allocation by **event‑based transfer** (e.g., at “delivery”).[10][11]\n   - Liability limitations: allocation by **exclusion, limitation, indemnity, or disclaimer** of certain categories of damages or claims.[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n   - Non‑transferability: allocation by **restricting assignment or transfer** of rights/obligations or terminating rights upon transfer of the underlying asset.[2][3][4][10][11]\n\n3. **Legal effect on parties’ rights and obligations**\n   - Risk of loss: determines which party must absorb losses from damage at different stages of performance.[10][11]\n   - Liability limitations: determines what kinds of damages can be recovered and from whom, and under what conditions (e.g., only for gross negligence).[1][2][3][4][5][6]\n   - Non‑transferability: determines **who** can claim benefits or is bound to perform; later purchasers or unapproved assignees may have **no rights** under the warranty or contract.[2][3][4][10][11]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **Purchase Contract** combines all three forms:\n  - Risk of loss allocation (Contractor vs. Customer, pre‑ and post‑delivery).[10][11]\n  - Assignment restriction (non‑transferability of the contract without consent).[10][11]\n  - Implicitly, by not expanding liability, it leaves general liability to background law, but the explicit risk‑of‑loss and assignment clauses are clear risk allocation tools.\n\n- The **Builder’s Limited Warranty** focuses on:\n  - **Liability limitations** via detailed exclusions and warranty disclaimers.[2][3][4]\n  - **Non‑transferability** via the “not transferable” clause and automatic termination upon sale or move‑out.[2][3][4]\n  - It does not use the phrase “risk of loss,” but its exclusions effectively allocate many categories of loss to the Buyer/Owner rather than the Builder.[2][3][4]\n\n- The **Property Management Agreement** contributes:\n  - A strong **liability limitation / indemnity** in favor of the Agent, shifting most property‑related loss and injury risk to the Owner.[1][5][6]\n\nTogether, these provisions show three distinct but complementary ways the parties allocate risk: by deciding who bears physical loss, who is legally liable for various damages, and who is allowed to hold or transfer the relevant rights and obligations.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe three different “risk allocation” statements across the set are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss statement**  \n   - “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.” (Purchase Contract §5)[10][11]  \n   - Distinct because it allocates **physical loss risk** based on the timing of delivery.\n\n2. **Liability limitation statements**  \n   - Property Management “Hold Harmless” clause limiting Agent’s liability to gross negligence or willful misconduct and requiring Owner to indemnify Agent.[1][5][6]  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty exclusions (e.g., consequential/incidentals, acts of God, bodily injury, certain property damage) and disclaimer of all other warranties.[2][3][4]  \n   - Distinct because they limit or exclude **legal liability and recoverable damages**, and shift responsibility for many losses to the Owner/Buyer.\n\n3. **Non‑transferability / assignment restriction statements**  \n   - Builder’s Limited Warranty “not transferable” clause, terminating the warranty upon sale or move‑out of the first purchaser.[2][3][4]  \n   - Purchase Contract assignment clause prohibiting assignment without the other party’s written consent.[10][11]  \n   - Distinct because they control **who may hold and enforce rights or obligations**, thereby allocating risk by confining benefits and burdens to specific parties.\n\nThese three categories—risk of loss, liability limitations, and non‑transferability—are distinguished by the type of risk they address, the mechanism they use to allocate that risk, and their legal effect on the parties’ rights and obligations.",

            "text": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1 – “Risk of loss” statements and wording\n\nAcross the set, there is one explicit “risk of loss” clause, in the Purchase Contract for the lift:\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Risk of Loss**  \n  “### 5. Risk of Loss  \n  Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\nThis is a classic risk‑allocation provision: it specifies which party bears the risk of loss or damage to the goods before and after delivery.\n\nNo other document in the provided context uses the phrase “risk of loss” or an equivalent explicit allocation of property‑damage risk in those terms. The other contracts allocate risk in different ways (warranty exclusions, indemnity, etc.), but not via a labeled “Risk of Loss” section.\n\n### Q2 / Q4 – “Liability limitations” statements and wording\n\nThere is no section literally titled “Limitation of Liability,” but several provisions function as liability‑limitation / risk‑allocation clauses.\n\n1. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Exclusions from Coverage**  \n   Under “4. Exclusions from Coverage,” the Builder disclaims responsibility for a wide range of damages and circumstances, including:  \n   - “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. (SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU).”[2][3][4]  \n   - “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.”[2][3][4]  \n   - Exclusions for damage from wear and tear, abuse, lack of maintenance, acts of God, etc.[2][3][4]  \n   - “Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.”[2][3][4]\n\n   These provisions limit the Builder’s liability by carving out categories of damages and circumstances that are not covered.\n\n2. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – No Other Warranties**  \n   “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH INCLUDE (BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO COVER THE PRESENCE OF RADON OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4][5]\n\n   This is a broad disclaimer of implied warranties, which is a form of liability limitation (it narrows the legal bases on which the Buyer/Owner can claim against the Builder).\n\n3. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Notification / Failure to Notify**  \n   “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[2][3][4][6]\n\n   This conditions the Builder’s liability on timely notice and expressly relieves the Builder of “all liability” if the condition is not met.\n\n4. **Property Management Agreement – Hold Harmless**  \n   “HOLD HARMLESS. The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5][6]\n\n   This clause both limits the Agent’s liability (no liability except for gross negligence or willful misconduct) and shifts risk to the Owner via an indemnity obligation.\n\n5. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Invalidity / Limitation of Implied Warranties**  \n   “In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Warranty shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and any implied warranties construed to be applicable or not disclaimable by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed limited to the warranty period (term) set forth herein.”[7][8]\n\n   This further limits any implied warranties that survive judicial scrutiny to the same term as the express warranty, constraining the Builder’s exposure.\n\nTaken together, these provisions function as the set’s **liability‑limitation / risk‑allocation statements**, even though they are not all labeled “Limitation of Liability.”\n\n### Q3 / Q5 – “Non‑transferability” statements and wording\n\nThe clearest non‑transferability provisions appear in the Builder’s Limited Warranty:\n\n- **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Not Transferable**  \n  “8. Not Transferable. This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\nThis clause allocates risk by limiting who can benefit from the warranty: only the first purchaser. Any subsequent owner bears the risk of defects without this warranty protection.\n\nOther contracts contain related “assignment” or “successors and assigns” language:\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Assignment**  \n  “## 8. Assignment  \n  Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\n  This is a mutual non‑assignment clause; it restricts transfer of contractual rights and obligations, which indirectly affects risk allocation (parties cannot unilaterally shift their contractual risks to third parties).\n\n- **Property Management Agreement – Successors and Assigns**  \n  “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[1][5][6]\n\n  This is the opposite: it ensures that, to the extent assignment or succession occurs, the obligations (and associated risks) follow successors and assigns.\n\nAmong these, the **explicit “Not Transferable” warranty clause** is the most direct “non‑transferability” statement tied to risk allocation, because it determines who bears the risk of construction defects over time.\n\n### Q6 – Comparison to the “risk of loss” wording\n\nComparing the three categories:\n\n1. **Risk of Loss clause**  \n   - Very short, binary allocation tied to a specific event (delivery):  \n     “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]  \n   - Focus: physical loss or damage to the lift during the project timeline.  \n   - Style: simple, temporal allocation (before vs. after delivery).\n\n2. **Liability‑limitation clauses**  \n   - More detailed and categorical. They:  \n     - Exclude types of damages (e.g., “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES”[2][3][4]).  \n     - Exclude causes (wear and tear, acts of God, negligence by others, etc.)[2][3][4].  \n     - Disclaim entire classes of legal theories (implied warranties of merchantability, fitness, habitability, etc.)[2][3][4][5].  \n     - Condition liability on procedural steps (timely notice, with failure “reliev[ing] the Builder of all liability”[2][3][4][6]).  \n     - Limit liability to egregious conduct (Agent liable only for “gross negligence or wilful misconduct”[1][5][6]).  \n   - Focus: narrowing the scope and duration of the promisor’s responsibility, rather than pinpointing a single moment when risk shifts.\n\n3. **Non‑transferability / assignment clauses**  \n   - Allocate risk across **persons over time**, rather than across **events** or **types of damage**:  \n     - Warranty “is not transferable” and “automatically terminates” when the first purchaser sells or moves out[2][3][4].  \n     - Contract “may [not] assign … without the other's written consent”[10][11].  \n   - Focus: who can claim benefits or be bound by obligations; they prevent risk from being shifted to or shared with third parties without consent.\n\nIn terms of wording:\n\n- The **risk of loss** clause is concise and event‑driven (“until delivery … thereafter”[10][11]).\n- The **liability limitations** are longer, enumerated, and often in all caps or formal legal style, emphasizing exclusions and disclaimers[2][3][4][5][6].\n- The **non‑transferability** clause uses status‑based language (“first purchaser,” “not transferable,” “automatically terminates”[2][3][4]) to define who is protected and when that protection ends.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- All three categories are **risk‑allocation mechanisms**, but they operate on different axes:\n  - **Risk of loss**: when physical risk shifts between parties in time (pre‑ vs. post‑delivery)[10][11].\n  - **Liability limitations**: what kinds of losses, causes, and legal theories are excluded or limited, and under what conditions[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].\n  - **Non‑transferability**: who can benefit from or be bound by the contract or warranty, and whether those rights/obligations can move to others[2][3][4][10][11].\n\n- The **Builder’s Limited Warranty** combines liability limitations and non‑transferability in a single instrument: it both narrows what is covered and restricts coverage to the first purchaser[2][3][4][5][7][8].\n\n- The **Property Management Agreement** uses an indemnity/hold‑harmless clause as its primary liability‑limitation device, shifting most on‑property risk to the Owner[1][5][6].\n\n- The **Purchase Contract** is the only document with an explicit “Risk of Loss” heading, and it also includes a non‑assignment clause, so it touches two of the three risk‑allocation themes[10][11].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the set, the three different “risk allocation” statement types are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**  \n   - “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n2. **Liability limitations**  \n   - Builder’s exclusions and disclaimers, including:  \n     - “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.”[2][3][4]  \n     - “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES … [are excluded].”[2][3][4]  \n     - “ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES … ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4][5]  \n     - “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency … relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[2][3][4][6]  \n     - Implied warranties, if any survive, “shall be deemed limited to the warranty period (term) set forth herein.”[7][8]  \n   - Property Management Agreement hold‑harmless clause:  \n     - “Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury … except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5][6]\n\n3. **Non‑transferability**  \n   - Warranty non‑transferability:  \n     - “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]  \n   - Contract non‑assignment:  \n     - “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\nThese three groups of clauses collectively allocate risk by (a) defining when risk shifts, (b) limiting the scope and basis of liability, and (c) restricting who can hold or transfer the rights and protections under the agreements.",

              "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1 – “Risk of loss” statements and wording\n\nAcross the set, there is one explicit “risk of loss” clause, in the Purchase Contract for the lift:\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Risk of Loss**  \n  “### 5. Risk of Loss  \n  Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\nThis is a classic risk‑allocation provision: it specifies which party bears the risk of loss or damage to the goods before and after delivery.\n\nNo other document in the provided context uses the phrase “risk of loss” or an equivalent explicit allocation of property‑damage risk in those terms. The other contracts allocate risk in different ways (warranty exclusions, indemnity, etc.), but not via a labeled “Risk of Loss” section.\n\n### Q2 / Q4 – “Liability limitations” statements and wording\n\nThere is no section literally titled “Limitation of Liability,” but several provisions function as liability‑limitation / risk‑allocation clauses.\n\n1. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Exclusions from Coverage**  \n   Under “4. Exclusions from Coverage,” the Builder disclaims responsibility for a wide range of damages and circumstances, including:  \n   - “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES. (SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU).”[2][3][4]  \n   - “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.”[2][3][4]  \n   - Exclusions for damage from wear and tear, abuse, lack of maintenance, acts of God, etc.[2][3][4]  \n   - “Bodily injury or damage to personal property or damage to real property which is not part of the original home as construction by Builder.”[2][3][4]\n\n   These provisions limit the Builder’s liability by carving out categories of damages and circumstances that are not covered.\n\n2. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – No Other Warranties**  \n   “This expressed limited warranty is the only warranty provided by Builder. ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHICH INCLUDE (BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO) WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, HABITABILITY, AND GOOD WORKMANSHIP AND ANY WARRANTY THAT MIGHT BE CONSTRUED TO COVER THE PRESENCE OF RADON OR OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4][5]\n\n   This is a broad disclaimer of implied warranties, which is a form of liability limitation (it narrows the legal bases on which the Buyer/Owner can claim against the Builder).\n\n3. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Notification / Failure to Notify**  \n   “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[2][3][4][6]\n\n   This conditions the Builder’s liability on timely notice and expressly relieves the Builder of “all liability” if the condition is not met.\n\n4. **Property Management Agreement – Hold Harmless**  \n   “HOLD HARMLESS. The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5][6]\n\n   This clause both limits the Agent’s liability (no liability except for gross negligence or willful misconduct) and shifts risk to the Owner via an indemnity obligation.\n\n5. **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Invalidity / Limitation of Implied Warranties**  \n   “In the event that any one or more of the provisions of this Warranty shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall be unaffected thereby and any implied warranties construed to be applicable or not disclaimable by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be deemed limited to the warranty period (term) set forth herein.”[7][8]\n\n   This further limits any implied warranties that survive judicial scrutiny to the same term as the express warranty, constraining the Builder’s exposure.\n\nTaken together, these provisions function as the set’s **liability‑limitation / risk‑allocation statements**, even though they are not all labeled “Limitation of Liability.”\n\n### Q3 / Q5 – “Non‑transferability” statements and wording\n\nThe clearest non‑transferability provisions appear in the Builder’s Limited Warranty:\n\n- **Builder’s Limited Warranty – Not Transferable**  \n  “8. Not Transferable. This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]\n\nThis clause allocates risk by limiting who can benefit from the warranty: only the first purchaser. Any subsequent owner bears the risk of defects without this warranty protection.\n\nOther contracts contain related “assignment” or “successors and assigns” language:\n\n- **Purchase Contract – Assignment**  \n  “## 8. Assignment  \n  Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\n  This is a mutual non‑assignment clause; it restricts transfer of contractual rights and obligations, which indirectly affects risk allocation (parties cannot unilaterally shift their contractual risks to third parties).\n\n- **Property Management Agreement – Successors and Assigns**  \n  “This Agreement shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Owner or Agent.”[1][5][6]\n\n  This is the opposite: it ensures that, to the extent assignment or succession occurs, the obligations (and associated risks) follow successors and assigns.\n\nAmong these, the **explicit “Not Transferable” warranty clause** is the most direct “non‑transferability” statement tied to risk allocation, because it determines who bears the risk of construction defects over time.\n\n### Q6 – Comparison to the “risk of loss” wording\n\nComparing the three categories:\n\n1. **Risk of Loss clause**  \n   - Very short, binary allocation tied to a specific event (delivery):  \n     “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]  \n   - Focus: physical loss or damage to the lift during the project timeline.  \n   - Style: simple, temporal allocation (before vs. after delivery).\n\n2. **Liability‑limitation clauses**  \n   - More detailed and categorical. They:  \n     - Exclude types of damages (e.g., “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES”[2][3][4]).  \n     - Exclude causes (wear and tear, acts of God, negligence by others, etc.)[2][3][4].  \n     - Disclaim entire classes of legal theories (implied warranties of merchantability, fitness, habitability, etc.)[2][3][4][5].  \n     - Condition liability on procedural steps (timely notice, with failure “reliev[ing] the Builder of all liability”[2][3][4][6]).  \n     - Limit liability to egregious conduct (Agent liable only for “gross negligence or wilful misconduct”[1][5][6]).  \n   - Focus: narrowing the scope and duration of the promisor’s responsibility, rather than pinpointing a single moment when risk shifts.\n\n3. **Non‑transferability / assignment clauses**  \n   - Allocate risk across **persons over time**, rather than across **events** or **types of damage**:  \n     - Warranty “is not transferable” and “automatically terminates” when the first purchaser sells or moves out[2][3][4].  \n     - Contract “may [not] assign … without the other's written consent”[10][11].  \n   - Focus: who can claim benefits or be bound by obligations; they prevent risk from being shifted to or shared with third parties without consent.\n\nIn terms of wording:\n\n- The **risk of loss** clause is concise and event‑driven (“until delivery … thereafter”[10][11]).\n- The **liability limitations** are longer, enumerated, and often in all caps or formal legal style, emphasizing exclusions and disclaimers[2][3][4][5][6].\n- The **non‑transferability** clause uses status‑based language (“first purchaser,” “not transferable,” “automatically terminates”[2][3][4]) to define who is protected and when that protection ends.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- All three categories are **risk‑allocation mechanisms**, but they operate on different axes:\n  - **Risk of loss**: when physical risk shifts between parties in time (pre‑ vs. post‑delivery)[10][11].\n  - **Liability limitations**: what kinds of losses, causes, and legal theories are excluded or limited, and under what conditions[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8].\n  - **Non‑transferability**: who can benefit from or be bound by the contract or warranty, and whether those rights/obligations can move to others[2][3][4][10][11].\n\n- The **Builder’s Limited Warranty** combines liability limitations and non‑transferability in a single instrument: it both narrows what is covered and restricts coverage to the first purchaser[2][3][4][5][7][8].\n\n- The **Property Management Agreement** uses an indemnity/hold‑harmless clause as its primary liability‑limitation device, shifting most on‑property risk to the Owner[1][5][6].\n\n- The **Purchase Contract** is the only document with an explicit “Risk of Loss” heading, and it also includes a non‑assignment clause, so it touches two of the three risk‑allocation themes[10][11].\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAcross the set, the three different “risk allocation” statement types are:\n\n1. **Risk of loss**  \n   - “Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.”[10][11]\n\n2. **Liability limitations**  \n   - Builder’s exclusions and disclaimers, including:  \n     - “The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty.”[2][3][4]  \n     - “CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES … [are excluded].”[2][3][4]  \n     - “ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES … ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.”[2][3][4][5]  \n     - “Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency … relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.”[2][3][4][6]  \n     - Implied warranties, if any survive, “shall be deemed limited to the warranty period (term) set forth herein.”[7][8]  \n   - Property Management Agreement hold‑harmless clause:  \n     - “Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury … except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.”[1][5][6]\n\n3. **Non‑transferability**  \n   - Warranty non‑transferability:  \n     - “This limited warranty is extended to the Buyer/Owner as the first purchaser of the home and is not transferable. In the event the first purchaser sells the home or moves out of it, this limited warranty automatically terminates.”[2][3][4]  \n   - Contract non‑assignment:  \n     - “Neither party may assign this contract without the other's written consent.”[10][11]\n\nThese three groups of clauses collectively allocate risk by (a) defining when risk shifts, (b) limiting the scope and basis of liability, and (c) restricting who can hold or transfer the rights and protections under the agreements.",

The header clearly identifies:\n\n- “Contoso Lifts LLC” at the top, followed by “INVOICE” and the tagline “Your elevator and lift experts.”  \n- The address block: “Contoso Lifts LLC, P.O. Box 123567 Key West, FL. 33304-0708” along with phone and fax numbers.  \n- Payment instructions: “Make all checks payable to Contoso Lifts LLC.”  \n\nAll of these indicate that **Contoso Lifts LLC** is the vendor issuing the invoice.[2]\n\nNo company registration number, VAT number, tax ID, or similar registration identifiers are shown anywhere on the invoice text. The only numeric identifiers present are:\n\n- INVOICE # 1256003  \n- CUSTOMER ID # 4905201  \n\nThese are internal invoice/customer references, not tax or VAT IDs.[2]\n\nSo, the vendor’s full legal name as shown is **“Contoso Lifts LLC”**, and there are **no vendor registration details (such as company registration number or tax ID) printed on the invoice**.[2]\n\n### Q2 & Q4: What is the exact vendor’s VAT / Tax ID number shown on the invoice?\n\nReviewing the entire invoice content, there is:\n\n- No field labeled “VAT,” “Tax ID,” “TIN,” “EIN,” or similar.  \n- No country-specific VAT prefix (e.g., “EU,” “DE,” “GB,” etc.).  \n- No number that is described as a tax identifier.\n\nThe only tax-related line is:\n\n- “TAX N/A” in the totals section.[2]\n\nSince no VAT or tax ID is printed anywhere in the invoice text, **there is no vendor VAT / Tax ID number shown on this invoice**.[2]\n\n### Q5: Relationship between vendor registration details and the VAT / Tax ID number\n\nOn this invoice:\n\n- Vendor registration details present:\n  - Legal name: “Contoso Lifts LLC”[2]  \n  - Postal address: “P.O.

In Hawaii, property management for others for compensation is conducted under a **real estate broker license** (held by the brokerage and/or its principal broker). However:\n\n- The documents provided **do not explicitly state** the type of license (e.g., “Hawaii Real Estate Broker License”) for Walt Flood Realty.\n- The only explicit license-related requirement in the agreement is for the **Owner** to provide their **General Excise Tax License** and **U.S. Federal Tax ID or Social Security number** [1], not a license for the Agent.\n\nTherefore, while it is reasonable to infer that Walt Flood Realty operates under a **Hawaii real estate broker/property management license**, this license type is **not expressly named** in the provided text.\n\n### Q3 & Q7: Where is the Agent’s license number stated or referenced?\n\nA review of the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (both pages and repeated excerpts) shows:\n\n- Identification of the Agent as **“Walt Flood Realty, a Hawaii sole proprietorship”** [1].\n- Signature lines for the Agent and Owner, with dates [1][3][4].\n- Fee schedules, responsibilities, governing law, etc. [1][3][4].\n\nNowhere in these sections is there:\n\n- A field labeled “License No.” or “License Number” for the Agent.\n- Any numeric identifier that is described as the Agent’s professional license number.\n\nOther documents in the corpus (e.g., **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** and **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**) do show explicit license/registration numbers for other parties:\n\n- The holding tank pumper’s **“Registration Number REG-54321”** is clearly labeled [7].\n  \nThis contrast shows that when a license/registration number is present, it is explicitly labeled.

In Hawaii, property management for others for compensation is conducted under a **real estate broker license** (held by the brokerage and/or its principal broker). However:\n\n- The documents provided **do not explicitly state** the type of license (e.g., “Hawaii Real Estate Broker License”) for Walt Flood Realty.\n- The only explicit license-related requirement in the agreement is for the **Owner** to provide their **General Excise Tax License** and **U.S. Federal Tax ID or Social Security number** [1], not a license for the Agent.\n\nTherefore, while it is reasonable to infer that Walt Flood Realty operates under a **Hawaii real estate broker/property management license**, this license type is **not expressly named** in the provided text.\n\n### Q3 & Q7: Where is the Agent’s license number stated or referenced?\n\nA review of the **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** (both pages and repeated excerpts) shows:\n\n- Identification of the Agent as **“Walt Flood Realty, a Hawaii sole proprietorship”** [1].\n- Signature lines for the Agent and Owner, with dates [1][3][4].\n- Fee schedules, responsibilities, governing law, etc. [1][3][4].\n\nNowhere in these sections is there:\n\n- A field labeled “License No.” or “License Number” for the Agent.\n- Any numeric identifier that is described as the Agent’s professional license number.\n\nOther documents in the corpus (e.g., **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** and **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**) do show explicit license/registration numbers for other parties:\n\n- The holding tank pumper’s **“Registration Number REG-54321”** is clearly labeled [7].\n  \nThis contrast shows that when a license/registration number is present, it is explicitly labeled.

(Customer) specifies the scope of work, payment amounts and milestones, governing law, and other terms, but it does **not** provide any bank account details, routing numbers, or other wire transfer / ACH instructions. The payment terms section only states that the total contract price of $29,900 is payable in three installments of $20,000 upon signing, $7,000 upon delivery, and $2,900 upon completion, without specifying payment method or banking coordinates.[10][13]\n\nThe related invoice from Contoso Lifts LLC likewise specifies the amount due ($29,900), indicates that checks should be made payable to Contoso Lifts LLC, and mentions that payments can also be made via an online portal, but again does **not** list any wire or ACH instructions such as bank name, account number, or routing number.[9]\n\nNo other provided documents (Builders Limited Warranty, Holding Tank Servicing Contract, Property Management Agreement) contain wire transfer or ACH instructions related to this purchase contract; they concern different relationships and obligations (warranty, servicing, property management) and do not supply banking details for the Contoso Lifts LLC–Fabrikam Inc. purchase contract.[1][2][8][11][12]\n\nTherefore, based on the available text, the purchase contract does not specify required wire transfer or ACH instructions.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The purchase contract defines **what** must be paid and **when** (three milestones totaling $29,900) but not **how** (no banking details).[10][13]\n- The invoice from the same contractor shows acceptable payment forms (checks and an online portal) but still omits any explicit wire/ACH fields.[9]\n- Other contracts in the corpus are unrelated agreements and contain no banking instructions applicable to this purchase contract.[1][2][8][11][12]\n\nTogether, these show that while payment obligations are clear, the specific wire/ACH instructions are absent from the provided contractual materials.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe purchase contract does **not** include any explicit wire transfer or ACH instructions (no bank name, routing number, or account number are provided).[10][13] The only payment-related directions in the available documents are to pay specified installment amounts under the contract and, per the related invoice, that checks be made payable to Contoso Lifts LLC or payment be made via their online portal, with no wire/ACH details given.[9]",

Box 123567, Key West, FL 33304‑0708[10][13]  \n- **Payer / Customer**: Fabrikam Inc., 61 S 34th Street, Dayton, FL 33155[10][13]  \n\nThe payment obligations are owed **by Fabrikam Inc. to Contoso Lifts LLC** under the Payment Terms section.[10][13]\n\nHowever, the contract never specifies any bank account or electronic transfer details for Contoso Lifts LLC. Thus:\n\n- We can identify **which party would receive payments** (Contoso Lifts LLC as Contractor)[10][13]  \n- But there is **no explicit tie** between that party and any wire/ACH instructions, because no such instructions are provided in the contract or in the cited documents.\n\n---\n\n### Q3: Who is responsible for making payments, and under what circumstances?\n\nThe Purchase Contract’s Payment Terms section states:\n\n- Total contract price: **$29,900.00**[10][13]  \n- Payable in three installments:  \n  - **$20,000.00 upon signing**[10][13]  \n  - **$7,000.00 upon delivery**[10][13]  \n  - **$2,900.00 upon completion**[10][13]  \n\nFrom the party definitions:\n\n- **Fabrikam Inc. is the “Customer”**[10][13]  \n- **Contoso Lifts LLC is the “Contractor”**[10][13]  \n\nThe structure of the Payment Terms and the Customer Default clause (“Failure to pay may result in legal action.

Payment Terms” in the Purchase Contract[10][13]  \n- **Obligor/obligee**: Fabrikam Inc. (Customer) must pay Contoso Lifts LLC (Contractor)[10][13]  \n- **Milestones**: signing, delivery, completion[10][13]  \n\nHowever, there is **no linkage at all** between these obligations and any wire/ACH instructions because:\n\n- No bank account or routing information appears in the Payment Terms or elsewhere in the Purchase Contract.[10][13]  \n- The invoice provides only check-payee information and an online portal URL, not wire/ACH details.[9]  \n\nThus, there is **no evidentiary basis** in the provided documents to show that any wire transfer / ACH instructions are associated with the payment obligations or with the intended party.\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The Purchase Contract clearly defines **who pays whom, how much, and when** (Fabrikam Inc. pays Contoso Lifts LLC $29,900 in three milestones).[10][13]  \n- The same parties appear on the related invoice, which confirms Contoso Lifts LLC as the payee and Fabrikam Construction/Inc. as the customer, and instructs that checks be made payable to Contoso Lifts LLC.[9]  \n- Across all provided documents (warranty, holding tank contract, property management agreement, invoice, and Purchase Contract), **none** contain any wire transfer or ACH banking instructions.[1][2][8][9][10][11][12][13]  \n- Therefore, while the **payment obligations and responsible parties are clearly established**, the **method-specific details for wire/ACH transfers are absent** and not contractually linked to those obligations.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe Purchase Contract between Contoso Lifts LLC and Fabrikam Inc. **does not specify any wire transfer or ACH instructions**. It defines the total price and three payment milestones and makes Fabrikam Inc. responsible for paying Contoso Lifts LLC,[10][13] but it does not provide any bank account, routing number, or other electronic funds transfer details.
