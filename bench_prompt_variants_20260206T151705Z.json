the sixty-day period applies to specified items like doors, windows, and fixtures [12][13].\n- **Within 3 business days (Purchase Contract):**\n  - Defined as the period after contract signing during which the customer may cancel for a full refund [2][6].\n- **Within ten (10) business days (Holding Tank Servicing Contract):**\n  - Defined as the period after a change in the contract during which the owner must file the updated contract with the municipality and county [14].\n- **Sixty (60) days written notice (Property Management Agreement):**\n  - Defined as the advance notice required by either party to terminate the agreement [5].\n- **Less than 180 days / More than 180 days (Property Management Agreement):**\n  - Defined as the duration of rental reservations or leases, used to determine the applicable management fee percentage [7][8].\n\n### Q3: How is the positioning of each time window specified relative to events?\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty:**\n  - The warranty period begins at the earlier of \"final settlement\" or \"first occupancy\" [3][4].\n  - Claims must be made \"prior to the termination\" of the applicable period [6].\n- **Purchase Contract:**\n  - The 3-business-day cancellation window starts from the contract signing [2][6].\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract:**\n  - The 10-business-day window starts from the \"date of change to this service contract\" [14].\n- **Property Management Agreement:**\n  - The 60-day notice period is positioned before the desired termination date [5].\n  - The 180-day threshold is used to classify the length of a reservation or lease, with no explicit event other than the start and end of the rental period [7][8].\n\n### Q4: Patterns, similarities, or differences across the set\n\n#### (a) Identification:\n- All time windows are explicitly stated in terms of days (or years, which are then referenced as 365 days for practical purposes).\n- Most are tied to a specific event (e.g., contract signing, occupancy, change in contract, reservation/lease start).\n\n#### (b) Definition:\n- Some windows are defined as fixed durations (e.g., 60 days, 3 business days).\n- Others are thresholds for classification (e.g., less than/more than 180 days).\n- The start and end points are generally clear, often linked to a triggering event.\n\n#### (c) Positioning:\n- Most windows are positioned as \"after\" a triggering event (e.g., after signing, after occupancy, after contract change).\n- The 60-day notice is \"before\" a future event (termination).\n- The 180-day threshold is used to categorize the nature of a rental period, not as a window for action.\n\n### Q5: Specific day-based time windows, durations, start/end points, and qualifiers\n\n| Document                        | Time Window                | Duration/Threshold | Start Point/Event                        | End Point/Event/Qualifier                        |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY        | Warranty period           | 1 year / 60 days   | Final settlement or first occupancy      | 1 year / 60 days after start                     |\n| BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY        | Claim submission          | 1 year / 60 days   | Warranty period start                    | Before warranty period ends                      |\n| PURCHASE CONTRACT                | Right to cancel           | 3 business days    | Contract signing                         | 3 business days after signing                    |\n| HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT  | File contract changes     | 10 business days   | Date of contract change                  | 10 business days after change                    |\n| PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT    | Termination notice        | 60 days            | Notice given                             | 60 days after notice                             |\n| PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT    | Short/long term rental    | 180 days           | Reservation/lease start                  | Reservation/lease end; used as a threshold       |\n\n### Q6: Explicit definitions and criteria for beginning/end\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty:** Begins at the earlier of final settlement or occupancy; ends after 1 year or 60 days, depending on the item [3][4][12][13].\n- **Purchase Contract:** Begins at contract signing; ends after 3 business days [2][6].\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract:** Begins at date of contract change; ends after 10 business days [14].\n- **Property Management Agreement:** Notice period begins when notice is given; ends after 60 days [5]. Rental period classification is based on whether the reservation/lease is less than or more than 180 days [7][8].\n\n### Q7: Positioning rules (before/after events)\n\n- **Builders Limited Warranty:** After occupancy/settlement; claims must be made before period ends [3][4][6].\n- **Purchase Contract:** After signing; cancellation must occur within 3 business days [2][6].\n- **Holding Tank Servicing Contract:** After contract change; filing must occur within 10 business days [14].\n- **Property Management Agreement:** Notice must be given at least 60 days before termination [5]. Rental classification is based on the total duration, not a window for action [7][8].\n\n### Q8: Patterns, similarities, differences (identification, definition, positioning)\n\n- **Identification:** All windows are clearly labeled with explicit durations or thresholds.\n- **Definition:** Most are fixed periods following a triggering event; some are thresholds for classification.\n- **Positioning:** Most are \"after\" a triggering event; one is \"before\" (notice before termination); one is a threshold for classification.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Triggering Events:** Most time windows are anchored to a clear event (signing, occupancy, contract change, notice given).\n- **Action Required:** Many windows define periods during which a party must act (submit a claim, cancel, file paperwork, give notice).\n- **Classification vs. Action:** Some windows (e.g., 180 days) are used to classify types of agreements rather than to define a period for action.\n- **Consistency:** There is a consistent approach to defining windows: explicit duration, clear start/end, and linkage to contractual events.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Explicit day-based timeframes across the document set are consistently defined as fixed periods (e.g., 1 year, 60 days, 3 business days, 10 business days, 60 days) or as thresholds for classification (e.g., 180 days). These windows are always anchored to a specific event (such as contract signing, occupancy, contract change, or notice given), with clear rules for when the window begins and ends. Most windows require action within the period following the event, while some (like the 60-day notice) require action before a future event. The use of explicit, event-linked, day-based timeframes is a common pattern across all contracts analyzed.** [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][12][13][14]",

          "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1 & Q5: Which documents include a percentage-based fee, and how is that percentage-based fee characterized?\n\nThe **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the only document in the corpus that includes percentage-based fees. Specifically:\n- **25% of gross revenues** for management services for short-term/vacation rentals (reservations of less than 180 days) [13][14][17].\n- **10% of gross revenues** for management services for long-term leases (leases of more than 180 days) [13][14][17].\n- **10% fee** on the total charge for repairs, upgrades, and/or renovations [13][14][17].\n\nThese fees are described as \"fee/commission\" and are calculated as a percentage of the gross revenues or total charges for specific services. They are charged as part of the agent's compensation for managing the property and for overseeing repairs or upgrades. The timing is ongoing, as these are assessed as services are rendered or income is received.\n\n### Q2 & Q6: Which documents include a flat fee, and how is that flat fee characterized?\n\nThe **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** also includes several flat fees:\n- **$75.00/month** pro-ration charge for advertising for short-term (vacation rentals) [13][14][17].\n- **$50.00/month** minimum charge for administration and accounting (excluding tax preparation) [13][14][17].\n- **$35/hour** charge to schedule repairs, upgrades, renovations, or to escort contractors [13][14][17].\n- **$250.00** non-refundable agency start-up fee, payable upon execution of the agreement, used for initial administrative expenses, inventory, and inspection [13][14][17].\n\nThese flat fees are clearly labeled, with their amounts, purposes, and timing (monthly or upon agreement execution) specified.\n\n### Q3 & Q7: Which documents include a deposit, and how is that deposit characterized?\n\nThe **purchase_contract** includes a deposit concept:\n- The contract price is paid in three installments, with **$20,000.00 due upon signing** [4][5]. This functions as an initial deposit.\n- The contract explicitly states: \"Customer may cancel within 3 business days for full refund. Afterward, deposit is forfeited\" [4][5].\n- The deposit is thus characterized as an upfront payment to secure the contract, refundable only if canceled within three business days; otherwise, it is forfeited.\n\nNo other documents in the corpus explicitly mention a deposit.\n\n### Q4 & Q8: Comparative summary\u2014Which documents use percentage-based fees, flat fees, and/or deposits? Any combinations?\n\n- **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT**: Uses both percentage-based fees (for management and repairs) and flat fees (advertising, administration, hourly charges, start-up fee) [13][14][17]. It does **not** require a deposit in the sense of a refundable security deposit, but does require a non-refundable start-up fee.\n- **purchase_contract**: Requires a deposit (initial payment/installment), which is refundable only if canceled within three days; does **not** use percentage-based or flat service fees beyond the contract price [4][5].\n- **contoso_lifts_invoice**: Lists itemized charges for goods/services, but these are not characterized as flat fees for services or as deposits; rather, they are line items for products delivered [9].\n- **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT**: Refers to \"charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon,\" but does not specify percentage-based fees, flat fees, or deposits [12].\n- **BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY**: Does not mention any percentage-based fees, flat fees, or deposits. It is focused on warranty terms and arbitration [1][2][3][6][7][8][15][16].\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is unique in using both percentage-based and flat fees, and it provides detailed characterization of each, including the basis for calculation, timing, and purpose [13][14][17].\n- The **purchase_contract** is the only document that clearly requires a deposit, with explicit terms for refund or forfeiture [4][5].\n- No document in the corpus uses all three fee types (percentage-based, flat, and deposit) together.\n- The **contoso_lifts_invoice** and **HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT** do not fit the classic definitions of these fee types as described in the original query.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**Summary Table:**\n\n| Document                        | Percentage-Based Fee | Flat Fee(s)           | Deposit                |\n|----------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|\n| PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT    | Yes (10%, 25%)      | Yes ($75/mo, $50/mo, $35/hr, $250 start-up) | No (but has non-refundable start-up fee) |\n| purchase_contract                | No                  | No (contract price only) | Yes ($20,000 deposit, refundable only if canceled within 3 days) |\n| contoso_lifts_invoice            | No                  | No (itemized product charges) | No                     |\n| HOLDING TANK SERVICING CONTRACT  | No                  | No (unspecified charges) | No                     |\n| BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY        | No                  | No                    | No                     |\n\n**Final Answer:**  \n- The **PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT** is the only document that uses percentage-based fees (for management and repairs) and also includes several flat fees (for advertising, administration, hourly services, and a start-up fee) [13][14][17].\n- The **purchase_contract** is the only document that requires a deposit, defined as an initial payment that is refundable only if the contract is canceled within three business days; otherwise, it is forfeited [4][5].\n- No document uses all three fee types together, and the other documents do not include these fee concepts as defined in the original query.\n\nAll claims are supported by the cited evidence.",

Risk of Loss\" in the PURCHASE CONTRACT.  \n   - States: \"Contractor holds risk until delivery. Customer holds risk thereafter.\" [9][12]\n\n2. **Hold Harmless/Indemnification Clause** (Property Management Agreement):  \n   - Labeled as \"HOLD HARMLESS\" in the PROPERTY MANAGEMENT AGREEMENT.  \n   - States: \"The Owner agrees that Agent shall not be liable for any claim for loss or injury to any person or property located on the property subject to this agreement, except for loss or injury caused by Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct, and Owner shall hold Agent harmless and indemnify Agent for any such claim or liability.\" [1][10][11]\n\n3. **Warranty Exclusion/Disclaimer Clause** (Builders Limited Warranty):  \n   - Labeled as \"Exclusions from Coverage\" and \"No Other Warranties\" in the BUILDERS LIMITED WARRANTY.  \n   - States: \"The Builder does not assume responsibility for any of the following, all of which are excluded from the coverage of this limited warranty...\" followed by a list of exclusions, and \"ALL OTHER WARRANTIES INCLUDING IMPLIED WARRANTIES...ARE HEREBY DISCLAIMED.\" [2][4][6]\n\n---\n\n### Q2 & Q5: For each of the three different \"risk allocation\" statements identified, what parties or entities are involved in the allocation of risk and liability?\n\n1. **Risk of Loss Clause**:  \n   - **Parties Involved:**  \n     - Contractor: Contoso Lifts LLC.  \n     - Customer: Fabrikam Inc.  \n   - **Description:** The clause specifies which party (Contractor or Customer) bears the risk of loss at different stages of the transaction. [9][12]\n\n2. **Hold Harmless/Indemnification Clause**:  \n   - **Parties Involved:**  \n     - Owner: Contoso Ltd.  \n     - Agent: Walt Flood Realty (Fabrikam Inc. as Principal Broker)  \n   - **Description:** The Owner agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Agent, except in cases of the Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct. [1][10][11]\n\n3. **Warranty Exclusion/Disclaimer Clause**:  \n   - **Parties Involved:**  \n     - Builder: Fabrikam Inc.  \n     - Buyer/Owner: Contoso Ltd.  \n   - **Description:** The Builder limits its liability by excluding certain risks from warranty coverage and disclaims all other warranties, shifting those risks to the Buyer/Owner. [2][4][6]\n\n---\n\n### Q3 & Q6: Comparing the three different \"risk allocation\" statements identified, in what distinct ways does each one shift liability, and how do these differences affect which party bears responsibility in various scenarios?\n\n1. **Risk of Loss Clause**:  \n   - **How Liability Shifts:**  \n     - The Contractor (Contoso Lifts LLC.) bears the risk of loss for the goods until delivery to the Customer (Fabrikam Inc.). After delivery, the Customer assumes all risk.  \n   - **Effect:**  \n     - If the goods are damaged or lost before delivery, the Contractor is responsible. If damage or loss occurs after delivery, the Customer is responsible. This creates a clear point of transfer for liability. [9][12]\n\n2. **Hold Harmless/Indemnification Clause**:  \n   - **How Liability Shifts:**  \n     - The Owner (Contoso Ltd.) assumes liability for most claims related to the property, agreeing to indemnify the Agent (Walt Flood Realty) for such claims, except when the Agent is grossly negligent or acts with willful misconduct.  \n   - **Effect:**  \n     - The Agent is protected from most third-party claims, and the Owner bears the risk and cost of such claims, unless the Agent's egregious conduct is involved. This shifts the majority of operational risk to the Owner. [1][10][11]\n\n3. **Warranty Exclusion/Disclaimer Clause**:  \n   - **How Liability Shifts:**  \n     - The Builder (Fabrikam Inc.) limits its liability by excluding coverage for a wide range of potential damages and defects, and by disclaiming all implied warranties. The Buyer/Owner (Contoso Ltd.) assumes responsibility for risks not expressly covered by the limited warranty.  \n   - **Effect:**  \n     - The Buyer/Owner cannot claim damages for excluded items or under implied warranties, bearing the risk for those scenarios. The Builder's liability is narrowly defined and limited to specific, enumerated circumstances. [2][4][6]\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Timing and Event-Based Shifts:** The \"Risk of Loss\" clause shifts liability based on a specific event (delivery), providing a clear demarcation of responsibility between Contractor and Customer.  \n- **Role-Based Shifts:** The \"Hold Harmless\" clause allocates risk based on the roles and actions of the parties, protecting the Agent except in cases of gross negligence, and placing most liability on the Owner.  \n- **Scope-Based Shifts:** The \"Warranty Exclusion/Disclaimer\" clause shifts risk by contractually narrowing the scope of the Builder's liability, leaving the Buyer/Owner responsible for all other risks not expressly covered.\n\nEach clause uses a different mechanism\u2014event, role, or scope\u2014to allocate risk and liability, affecting which party bears responsibility in various scenarios.\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**The three different \"risk allocation\" statements are:**\n\n1. **Risk of Loss Clause** (Purchase Contract): Shifts liability for loss or damage from the Contractor to the Customer at the point of delivery. [9][12]\n2. **Hold Harmless/Indemnification Clause** (Property Management Agreement): Shifts liability for most claims to the Owner, protecting the Agent except in cases of gross negligence or willful misconduct. [1][10][11]\n3. **Warranty Exclusion/Disclaimer Clause** (Builders Limited Warranty): Shifts liability for excluded risks and all implied warranties to the Buyer/Owner, limiting the Builder's responsibility to only those risks expressly covered. [2][4][6]\n\n**Each clause shifts liability in a distinct way\u2014by timing, by party role, or by contractual scope\u2014thereby determining which party bears responsibility under different circumstances.** This structured allocation of risk is fundamental to contract law and ensures clarity for all parties involved.",

          "response": "## Analysis\n\n### Q1 & Q4: How is an \u201cemergency defect\u201d specifically defined under the warranty, and what conditions must be met for a defect to qualify as an emergency defect?\n\nThe Builder\u2019s Limited Warranty does not provide a formal, explicit definition of \u201cemergency defect.\u201d However, it does describe the circumstances that constitute an emergency for notification purposes. The warranty states: \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone\u201d [4]. The example given\u2014\u201ca defective pipe has burst\u201d\u2014indicates that an emergency defect is a situation where immediate action is required to prevent further damage to the property. Thus, a defect qualifies as an emergency if it is urgent and delay would result in additional harm (e.g., water damage from a burst pipe).\n\n### Q2 & Q5: What notification channels are mentioned or allowed for reporting an emergency defect such as a burst pipe, and how are these methods described?\n\nThe warranty distinguishes between standard and emergency defect reporting channels. For non-emergency defects, the Buyer/Owner must \u201cwrite a letter describing the defect to the Builder and send it by certified mail return receipt requested to the Builder at the Builder\u2019s office address\u201d [4]. For emergency defects, the requirement is different: \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone\u201d [4]. The warranty provides an emergency phone number for this purpose [4]. Therefore, the only allowed notification channel for emergency defects is by telephone.\n\n### Q3 & Q6: What specific timeframes, procedures, or requirements are stated in the warranty for reporting an emergency defect such as a burst pipe, and how exactly is this reporting requirement worded or stated in the warranty?\n\nThe procedure and requirement for reporting an emergency defect are clearly stated: \u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone. Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages\u201d [4]. This means the notification must be made as soon as the emergency is discovered, and it must be done by phone. Prompt notification is critical; any delay or failure to use the required channel (telephone) may result in denial of coverage for the defect and any resulting damages.\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- The warranty makes a clear distinction between routine and emergency defect reporting, both in terms of channel (mail vs. phone) and urgency (routine vs. immediate).\n- The definition of an emergency defect is functional: it is any defect where delay would cause extra damage, with a burst pipe given as a specific example [4].\n- The only permitted notification channel for emergency defects is by telephone, and the warranty explicitly states that only emergency reports will be taken by phone [4].\n- Promptness is essential; failure to immediately notify the Builder by phone in the event of an emergency relieves the Builder of all liability for repair or damages [4].\n- The warranty provides a dedicated emergency phone number for such reports [4].\n\n## Conclusion\n\n**If an emergency defect occurs under the warranty (such as a burst pipe), the required notification channel is immediate telephone notification to the Builder using the provided emergency number. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone, and failure to promptly notify the Builder by phone relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and other damages.** [4]\n\n**Exact wording from the warranty:**  \n\u201cIf an emergency exists or if a delay will cause extra damage (for instance, a defective pipe has burst), the Buyer/Owner must telephone the Builder immediately. Only emergency reports will be taken by phone. Failure to promptly notify the Builder of an emergency under this limited warranty relieves the Builder of all liability for replacement, repair, and all other damages.\u201d [4]",
