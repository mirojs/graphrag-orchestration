Property Management Agreement \u2013 financial penalties for early termination\n\n**Termination rights and effects**\n\n- The Property Management Agreement has a 12\u2011month initial term and then auto\u2011renews for one\u2011year periods, but \u201ceither party upon sixty (60) days written notice may terminate this agreement.\u201d[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70]  \n- On termination:\n  - \u201cTermination of this agreement does not invalidate any existing rental agreements made by Agent on Owner's behalf.\u201d[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70]  \n  - \u201cUpon termination, Owner shall continue to be responsible or shall cause to be completed all obligations or expenses incurred hereunder by the Agent.\u201d[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70]  \n  - \u201cIn the event this agreement is terminated, or the property is sold, the Owner shall honor all confirmed reservations.\u201d[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70]  \n\n**Are there explicit \u201cfinancial penalties\u201d for early termination?**\n\n- The Agreement **does not contain any clause labeled as an early termination fee, liquidated damages, or penalty** for ending the contract before the end of the term.  \n- The only monetary obligations are the ongoing **Agent\u2019s fees** (commissions, monthly charges, etc.) and the **non\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee**:\n  - Commissions on gross revenues (25% short\u2011term, 10% long\u2011term)[6][8][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][31][32][35][36][39][41][43][49][50][71][72]  \n  - Monthly advertising, admin/accounting charges, and percentages on repairs, plus Hawaii excise tax[6][8][31][32][35][36][41][43][49][50][71][72]  \n  - A \u201cnon\u2011refundable start\u2011up fee\u201d of $250, paid \u201cupon the execution of this Agreement\u201d[6][8][31][32][35][36][41][43][49][50][71][72]. This is clearly non\u2011refundable but is not tied in the text to termination; it is earned for initial set\u2011up work.\n\n**How are the owner\u2019s financial obligations at termination calculated?**\n\n- The Owner must:\n  - Pay all **obligations or expenses incurred** by the Agent before termination[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70]. That would include:\n    - Any advertising already placed and billed[3][15][16][17][18][20][21]  \n    - Housekeeping/maintenance expenditures authorized by Agent[3][15][16][17][18][20][21]  \n    - Any earned commissions on rentals already booked or performed.\n  - Honor all confirmed reservations[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70]. Practically, this means the Owner must allow those guests to stay and pay the Agent the agreed commissions and fees on those stays, even if the management agreement itself has been terminated.\n\n**Limits or conditions**\n\n- There is **no formula** like \u201cX months of fees\u201d or \u201cY% of remaining term\u201d as a penalty.  \n- The Owner\u2019s continuing obligations are **limited to**:\n  - Paying for obligations/expenses already incurred by Agent[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70], and\n  - Honoring confirmed reservations (which implies continuing to pay the normal fee structure on those reservations).  \n- There is **no clause** that accelerates future fees or imposes extra damages solely because the Owner terminates early.\n\n**Summary for Q1**\n\nThe Property Management Agreement allows either party to terminate on 60 days\u2019 written notice and does **not** impose a separate, explicit \u201cearly termination penalty.\u201d The Owner must (1) pay all obligations/expenses already incurred by the Agent and (2) honor all confirmed reservations, with the usual fees applying to those reservations[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70]. The $250 start\u2011up fee is non\u2011refundable but is not framed as a termination penalty[6][8][31][32][35][36][41][43][49][50][71][72].\n\n---\n\n### Q2. Holding Tank Servicing Contract \u2013 financial penalties for early termination\n\n**Termination rights**\n\n- The Holding Tank Servicing Contract states: \u201cThis agreement will remain in effect until the owner or pumper terminates this contract.\u201d[2][19][38][69]  \n- It does not specify any required notice period or conditions for termination beyond that simple statement.\n\n**Are there explicit \u201cfinancial penalties\u201d for early termination?**\n\n- The contract contains **no clause** that:\n  - Charges an early termination fee,\n  - Requires payment of a minimum remaining term,\n  - Imposes liquidated damages, or\n  - Labels any payment as a penalty for ending the contract.\n- The owner\u2019s financial obligation is simply to \u201cpay the pumper for charges incurred in servicing the holding tank(s) as mutually agreed upon by the owner and pumper.\u201d[2][19][38][69]  \n- Clause 4 only adds an administrative requirement: if there is \u201ca change in this contract,\u201d the owner must file a copy of the changes or a new contract with the municipality and County within ten business days[2][19][38][69]. This is a regulatory filing obligation, not a financial penalty.\n\n**How are any amounts at termination calculated?**\n\n- The contract is silent on any special calculation at termination.  \n- The only amounts due are the normal service charges for work actually performed up to the date of termination, \u201cas mutually agreed upon\u201d[2][19][38][69]. There is no obligation to pay for future services or a minimum volume.\n\n**Limits or conditions**\n\n- There are **no financial conditions or limits** tied to termination.  \n- Termination appears to be at will by either party, with no contractual damages specified.\n\n**Summary for Q2**\n\nThe Holding Tank Servicing Contract allows either party to terminate the contract and imposes **no financial penalties** for early termination. The owner must pay only for services actually rendered up to termination, at the agreed rates[2][19][38][69], and must handle regulatory filing of any new or changed contract[2][19][38][69].\n\n---\n\n## Key Connections\n\n- **Presence of explicit penalties**  \n  - Property Management Agreement: No explicit early termination fee or liquidated damages; only continuing obligations for already\u2011incurred expenses and confirmed reservations[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70].  \n  - Holding Tank Contract: No explicit early termination fee, liquidated damages, or penalty of any kind[2][19][38][69].\n\n- **Scope of continuing financial obligations after termination**  \n  - Property Management Agreement: Broader. The Owner must:\n    - Pay all obligations/expenses incurred by Agent before termination[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70], and  \n    - Honor all confirmed reservations, which effectively extends the economic relationship for the duration of those bookings[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70].  \n  - Holding Tank Contract: Narrow. The Owner pays only for services actually performed up to termination, with no obligation to continue service or pay for future work[2][19][38][69].\n\n- **Non\u2011refundable amounts**  \n  - Property Management Agreement: The $250 start\u2011up fee is non\u2011refundable regardless of when termination occurs[6][8][31][32][35][36][41][43][49][50][71][72]. While not labeled as a termination penalty, it is a sunk cost that cannot be recovered if the Owner terminates early.  \n  - Holding Tank Contract: No non\u2011refundable upfront fee is specified[2][19][38][69].\n\n- **Practical strictness**  \n  - In practice, the Property Management Agreement is **more restrictive** around termination because the Owner cannot simply walk away; they must carry through all existing reservations and pay all related fees and expenses[3][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][39][47][70].  \n  - The Holding Tank Contract is **more flexible**; either party can terminate without any contractual financial consequence beyond paying for services already rendered[2][19][38][69].\n\n---\n\n## Conclusion\n\nComparing the strictness of \u201cfinancial penalties\u201d for early termination:\n\n- **Neither** the Property Management Agreement nor the Holding Tank Servicing Contract contains an explicit, standalone early termination fee or liquidated damages clause.  \n- However, the **Property Management Agreement is effectively stricter**: on termination, the Owner must (1) pay all obligations and expenses already incurred by the Agent and (2) honor all confirmed reservations, continuing to pay the normal commissions and fees on those stays, and the initial $250 start\u2011up fee is non\u2011refundable[3][6][8][15][16][17][18][20][21][27][29][30][31][32][35][36][39][41][43][47][49][50][70][71][72].  \n- The **Holding Tank Servicing Contract is more lenient**: either party may terminate, and the Owner\u2019s only financial obligation is to pay for services actually performed up to termination, with no additional penalties or non\u2011refundable start\u2011up charges[2][19][38][69].\n\nThus, while neither agreement imposes a formal \u201cearly termination penalty,\u201d the Property Management Agreement imposes more substantial continuing financial obligations upon termination and is therefore stricter in its practical financial consequences than the Holding Tank Servicing Contract.",
